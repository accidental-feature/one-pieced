#### Romance Dawn: The Origin of an Adventure![]

Gold Roger, the  Pirate King, had attained enormous wealth, fame, and power. Before he was executed, he announced to the crowd that he had left all his treasure at a  certain place, causing the  world to enter the Great Age of  Pirates.

Eleven years later, the  Red Hair Pirates came to a small port village named  Foosha Village. After a year of them being there, a young boy named  Monkey D. Luffy came to their ship to prove he was tough enough to join them by stabbing his face under his left eye. The pirates and Luffy then went to the bar, where the pirates toasted to Luffy's craziness as they ate and drank. Luffy tried to convince the captain,  "Red-Haired" Shanks, to let him join the crew, but Shanks gently refused due to Luffy being too young and unable to swim.

Suddenly, a group of mountain bandits led by  Higuma entered the bar and demanded alcohol. The bartender  Makino told them that the pirates had drank all of it already, and when Shanks offered Higuma the last bottle, he responded by breaking it over Shanks' head, not fearing the pirate due to his 8,000,000  bounty. Shanks simply responded by apologizing and cleaning up the mess, causing Higuma to break some more dishes before leaving with his gang. Afterwards, the Red Hair Pirates just laughed, but Luffy was angry at Shanks for not standing up for himself. He stormed out of the bar, and Shanks tried to grab his arm to hold him back, but to his shock Luffy kept walking as his arm stretched like rubber. The Red Hair Pirates then realized that the  Devil Fruit they had stolen, the  Gomu Gomu no Mi, was no longer in its chest, and Luffy confirmed that he had eaten it for dessert. Shanks revealed that Luffy's body was now made of rubber due to eating the Devil Fruit, and he would be unable to swim for the rest of his life.

Sometime later, the Red Hair Pirates had gone off on another voyage, and Luffy was starting to have fun with his new rubber body. One day, however, he was sitting in Makino's bar when Higuma's gang returned and demanded alcohol. Soon afterwards, Makino alerted the mayor,  Woop Slap, that Luffy had been kidnapped by the bandits after picking a fight with them. Higuma initially planned to sell Luffy to a circus due to his strange body, but then decided to kill him for angering him. However, Shanks and the Red Hair Pirates then returned, and when one of the bandits pointed his gun at Shanks, the pirate  Lucky Roux shot him. Shanks stated that he could accept an insult toward him, but would not forgive anyone who harms his friends. His  first mate,  Benn Beckman then overpowered the bandits singlehandedly, though Higuma managed to escape with Luffy in tow by throwing a smoke bomb. Higuma took Luffy out to sea and kicked him off the boat to drown him, and as Luffy struggled to stay afloat, a  Sea King known as  Lord of the Coast came to eat Higuma. It then moved to eat Luffy, but Shanks arrived in the nick of time to save Luffy and  scare the beast away. Shanks was glad Luffy was okay, but Luffy was saddened that he had lost his arm in the process of saving him.

Later, the Red Hair Pirates were preparing to leave Foosha Village for good. Luffy had decided that he would not try to join them and declared that he would form his own crew that would be stronger than Shanks', find the greatest treasure, and become the Pirate King. To take Luffy up on his word, Shanks gave him his  straw hat and told him to return it once he had surpassed him. As the Red Hair Pirates set sail, Shanks and Beckman both anticipated Luffy doing big things in the future.

#### On the High Seas: Luffy's First Voyage[]

Ten years later, Luffy set sail on his own in a small rowboat. The Lord of the Coast came to confront him, and he quickly took it out with , where he stretched his arm forward and unleashed a long-range punch. As he drifted out to sea, Luffy plotted to recruit at least 10 crewmates, make a  Jolly Roger, and become the Pirate King. However, he quickly ran into trouble as his boat was pulled into a whirlpool with no way of escaping.

Meanwhile, a pirate ship was docked at a remote island. The captain,  Alvida, abused her subordinates for not working to clean the ship, especially the cabin boy  Koby, whom she sent ashore to their base. Koby found a barrel that had washed ashore and rolled it to the wine cellar, and three of his crewmates, thinking the barrel had alcohol in it, decided to open it and drink in secret. To their shock, however, Luffy burst out of the barrel, having takenÂ a nap inside it. The resulting commotion caused Alvida to throw her giant mace into the building and cause it to collapse, and her three henchmen told her about Koby bringing in Luffy as they had both escaped.

Luffy and Koby went into the nearby forest, and the former asked the latter if he had a small boat. Koby showed Luffy the small boat he had made himself in order to escape from Alvida after accidentally falling into her crew's clutches two years ago, but he let Luffy have it since he was too afraid to run away from Alvida. Luffy did not think much about Koby and his cowardice, saying he did not mind dying for the sake of achieving his dream of becoming the Pirate King and finding the  One Piece. This caused Koby to contemplate making the effort to achieve his own dream of joining the  Marines and arresting pirates like Alvida. Suddenly, Alvida and her crew came to confront Luffy and Koby as she destroyed the latter's boat. Alvida gave Koby the chance to stay alive by calling her the most beautiful in all the seas, but Luffy then insulted her offhandedly when asking Koby who she was. Koby initially started berating Luffy, but then remembered what he had told him and decided to stand up to Alvida and insult her instead. Alvida prepared to hit Koby with her mace, but an impressed Luffy then jumped in and intercepted the mace, with it not hurting him due to his rubber body. He then hit Alvida to the ground with  and told her crew to get Koby a boat, to which they quickly complied.

#### The Oppressive Axe of the Marines: Recruiting a Swordsman[]

As they sailed away, Koby noted that for Luffy to achieve his dream he would have to enter the  Grand Line, a place known as the pirate's graveyard. Luffy responded that he would form a powerful crew to survive it, and decided to recruit the  bounty hunter and Marine prisoner  Roronoa Zoro after hearing about him from the Alvida Pirates; this shocked Koby, who believed Zoro to be a demonic beast. Thanks to Koby's navigation skills, the duo were able to reach  Shells Town, where the Marine base holding Zoro was stationed. Luffy and Koby ate at a restaurant before they intended to part ways, and the customers around them jumped when Luffy mentioned Zoro's name. Koby then recalled noticing that  Captain  Morgan was at this base, and to his surprise, the customers jumped again after hearing Morgan's name.

Luffy and Koby then walked up to the Marine base, and they found Zoro tied to a crucifix in the parade ground behind the outer wall. Zoro asked Luffy to free him, when suddenly a young girl named  Rika climbed over the wall to feed him rice balls. However, Morgan's son  Helmeppo then came in and took the rice balls, but then spit them out and stomped them into the ground due to them being sweet. He pointed out to the upset Rika that helping Zoro was a crime and ordered one of the Marines accompanying him to throw her over the wall. The Marine did so reluctantly, and Luffy caught Rika. When Helmeppo's group had left, Luffy went into the parade ground to recruit Zoro. Zoro refused to become a pirate as he had his own agenda, revealing that Helmeppo had agreed to free him if he stayed here a month without food. However, he then asked Luffy to feed him the rice balls that Helmeppo had stomped into the ground; despite them being mixed with a large amount of dirt, he told Luffy to tell Rika they were delicious.

Luffy returned to Shells Town and told Rika this, to her delight. She revealed that Captain Morgan and Helmeppo ruled harshly over the town and had people put to death for little reason; Zoro had done nothing wrong, as he was arrested after saving her from one of Helmeppo's ferocious dogs. Helmeppo then came walking into town and ordered the citizens to bow down to him. He stated that Zoro would be executed in three days, causing Luffy to confront him over the promise he made. Helmeppo revealed that he was only joking about that, causing Luffy to punch him to the ground. Koby had to hold Luffy back from attacking him further, but Helmeppo promised to tell his father and get his revenge. As the citizens retreated into their homes, Luffy headed back to the Marine base to recruit Zoro again.

Luffy went back to Zoro, who once again refused to join his pirate crew. Luffy then wondered where Zoro's swords were, and he revealed that Helmeppo had taken them. Luffy decided to retrieve Zoro's swords and give them back if he joined him, much to Zoro's shock and ire. Inside the Marine base, Morgan asked a soldier why the citizens' tributes to him were growing smaller. The Marine replied that the town was growing poorer, but Morgan considered this to be a matter of their respect to him. Helmeppo then came and told Morgan to kill Luffy, but Morgan ignored this as he went up to the roof to oversee his men erect a massive statue of himself. Helmeppo asked why his father was not going after someone who attacked him, and Morgan responded that Helmeppo was old enough to fight his own battles; he only killed people who defied him. On that note, he inquired about Rika trespassing on the parade ground, and upon finding out that Helmeppo let her live, he ordered one of his men to kill her. When the soldier refused, Morgan struck him down with his giant  axe hand. Meanwhile, Luffy was looking for someone to guide him to Zoro's swords and heard noises coming from the roof, so he stretched his arms to pull himself up there. His velocity resulted in him flying over the roof, so he grabbed onto the ropes the Marines were using to pull up Morgan's statue, causing the statue to fall down and split in two. Morgan was instantly furious and told his men to apprehend Luffy, and Luffy captured Helmeppo and took him inside the base to find out where Zoro's swords were.

Helmeppo told Luffy that he put Zoro's swords in his room, and when Luffy was confronted by some Marines, he used Helmeppo as a shield to protect himself. Luffy made his way into Helmeppo's room and saw three swords, but Helmeppo had fainted and so could not tell him which ones were Zoro's. As many of the Marines chased Luffy, one of them noticed Koby trying to free Zoro and told Morgan. Koby wished to be a proper sailor and stand up to the corrupt actions of this Marine base and told Zoro that Luffy wanted to become the Pirate King. However, he was then shot in the shoulder by one of the Marines on the base roof. Zoro told Koby to escape before the Marines got down to them, but Koby revealed that Zoro'sÂ agreement with Helmeppo was a lie and that Luffy had punched Helmeppo after finding this out. He asked Zoro to help Luffy if he untied them, but Morgan and his troops then stormed the parade ground and held the two of them at gunpoint. Morgan ordered his men to shoot them, and Zoro grew worried as he had sworn to not die until he had fulfilled a promise.

When he was young, Zoro trained in a dojo and had lost in practice duels to  Kuina, the dojo master  Koushirou's daughter, 2000 times in a row. He was frustrated over his losing, and one night challenged Kuina to a duel with real swords. Kuina beat him again, and Zoro became even more frustrated, but she then revealed that she was frustrated too as she was entering puberty and her father had said that men would always eclipse women in strength. This made Zoro mad, as he wanted to beat her because he had worked hard rather than because of his gender. He and Kuina then made a promise with each other that they would each work to become the Greatest Swordsman in the World and duel each other for the title. The next day, however, Zoro found out that Kuina had died after falling down the stairs. He asked Koushirou if he could have  her sword, and emotionally declared that he would fulfill their promise for both of them and become the greatest swordsman possible.

In the present, as the Marines shot at Koby and Zoro, Luffy jumped out of the window and landed in front of them, causing the bullets to hit his body and ricochet back at the Marines. Luffy presented the swords to Zoro, who revealed that he wielded all three of them as a  Three Sword Style user. With the Marines now unquestionably against him, Zoro decided to take up on Luffy's offer and become a pirate. The Marines then took out their swords and charged toward Luffy and Zoro, and Zoro told Luffy to give him his swords, allowing him to cut himself free and intercept all of the Marines at once. Luffy then hit all of the Marines with a stretched leg to knock them away. Morgan ordered his men to shoot themselves for their incompetence, and Luffy charged to fight him. Luffy quickly got the upper hand against Morgan, but Helmeppo then held Koby at gunpoint to stop Luffy from harming his father. Koby did not flinch in the face of death, and Luffy simply punched Helmeppo with . Morgan rose back up to attack him from behind as he did this, but Zoro quickly cut him down. As Morgan and Helmeppo lay defeated, the Marines started celebrating.

Luffy, Zoro, and Koby went to Rika's mother's restaurant to eat, and Luffy and Zoro plotted to head for the Grand Line. Koby warned them against this as their friend but thanked them for teaching him to stand up for himself. The Marines then came to the restaurant, and although they were grateful to the pirates for defeating their captain, they still asked for them to leave. Luffy and Zoro did so, and the Marines asked Koby if he was going with them. Luffy then started to tell them about Koby's history with Alvida, causing Koby to punch him. Luffy punched back and started a brawl, causing the Marines to believe they were not friends. As Luffy and Zoro left, Koby asked the Marines to let him enlist, promising to work any job. Although one soldier still did not trust him, the chief Marine accepted his request. As Luffy and Zoro set sail, Koby then arrived to salute them, and to his surprise he was joined by the rest of the Marines in thanking the pirates. Luffy told Koby they would meet again and looked forward to heading for the Grand Line.

### __Orange Town Arc__

#### The Thief and the Red-Nosed Pirate[]

The arc begins with  Luffy and  Zoro out at sea, lost and starving, due to the fact that neither of them have any sense of direction. Luffy spots a bird in the air and uses his Devil Fruit powers to try and catch it so that they can eat it. However, the bird turns out to be much larger than expected and flies off with Luffy in its mouth. Zoro rows after him but comes across three pirates struggling in the ocean. They jump onto Zoro's boat as he passes them (since he cannot stop) and then try to steal the boat from Zoro, only to get beaten up for it. The pirates then apologize for their actions, recognizing Zoro as the famous pirate hunter, and they explain to him how their situation came about. They were returning from successfully plundering a ship when they came across a small boat drifting the ocean with a female passenger on board. She asked for some food and water and offered a treasure chest as payment. TheyÂ decided to check the chest first, only to find it empty and that the girl had stolen their boat. A sudden maelstrom appeared and sunk the small boat along with the pirates, while the girl waved goodbye as she droveÂ off with their boat.

Back in the present, the pirates growl about getting revenge and worry about what their captain  Buggy will do to them if they come back empty-handed, as Zoro wonders who Buggy is. Meanwhile, in a small village named  Orange Town, a pirate ship designed asÂ a carousel is docked near the town. One of the pirates on the ship spots Luffy and the bird, alerting the captain, who orders him to shoot it down. In the town, the same girl who had robbed the pirates is running away from three more angry pirates, who are yelling at her to return a map of the Grand Line she stole. An explosion halts the chase for a moment, and something crashes in the middle of the four. Luffy emerges from the smoke unharmed, wondering what shot at him. The girl suddenly gets an idea and calls Luffy "boss", asking him to take care of the pirates. The pirates crowd around Luffy, one of them striking his head and knocking off his straw hat. This angers Luffy, and he easily defeats all three. The girl, who was watching, is impressed by his abilities and introduces herself as  Nami, a thief who specializes in robbing pirates.

Nami at first tries to form a partnership with Luffy, but when she finds out he is a pirate, she switches to the idea to pretending to turn Luffy into Buggy as her former boss. She ties up Luffy and gives him to Buggy, who locks him in a cage. Later, Nami pretends to join Buggy's crew so she can steal his gold. This works well, until Buggy orders her to kill Luffy to prove her loyalty. Nami's conscience gets the best of her, and she is compelled to save Luffy instead. Fortunately, Zoro shows up in time to save them both. He fights Buggy, cutting him into pieces and marveling at how easily he was defeated. However, when Zoro turns around, he finds that Buggy's hand has managed to detach itself, stabbing him in his midsection. Buggy reveals he has eaten a  Devil Fruit giving him the power to  detach his body parts and separate them into sections, rendering him invulnerable against sharp objects such as swords. However, Luffy, Zoro, and Nami manage to escape by firing Buggy's cannon at him and  his crew.

#### The Town's Last Citizen: Boodle the Mayor[]

Escaping into the empty town, the three meet a dog,  Chouchou, and the mayor of Orange Town,  Boodle. The mayor explains the dog's situation, where he is continuing to guard his master's pet shop, despite knowing his master is dead. The talk is interrupted by the arrival of Buggy's first mate,  Mohji, and his pet lion,  Richie. Nami and Boodle escape (Zoro is recovering from his wound in the mayor's house), but Luffy is still stuck in the cage Buggy imprisoned him in when Nami turned him in.

Richie attacks Luffy, breaking the cage and sending Luffy flying through a house. Noticing the pet store, Richie then turns his attention towards it. Chouchou defends it to the best of his ability but is no match for the lion. When Luffy comes back to the area, he sees the pet shop burned to the ground and the dog heartbroken over it. Luffy then confronts Mohji and Richie, defeating both of them easily before taking the last box of dog food left from the store and giving it to Chouchou.

#### Buggy's Flashy Finale: The Crew Departs[]

Boodle, inspired by Luffy's courage, goes to confront Buggy, but is almost choked to death. Luckily, Luffy, Zoro and Nami arrive and save him, before knocking him out to make sure he doesn't get in the way. Zoro fights with  Cabaji, Buggy's second mate and swordsman, and defeats him despite his wounds.

Luffy finally takes on Buggy while Nami sneaks off to steal Buggy's treasure. During the fight, Buggy reveals that he is  Shanks' acquaintance, as well as how he gained his powers and his grudge against Shanks because of it. He then sets off after Nami when he spots her taking his loot, but Luffy saves her. As Buggy separates his body parts again, preparing for another attack on Luffy, Nami steals some of them, tying the stolen body parts together. Buggy is left with just his hands, feet and head, leaving him vulnerable as Luffy sends him flying. Nami gives Luffy the map of the  Grand Line as she thanks him, agreeing to partner up with him for the time being.

As the trio starts to relax, the townspeople come back into the town, and, upon seeing their mayor knocked out, demand answers. Luffy replies that the three are pirates and he simply felt like knocking him out, and the townspeople chase them out of town, though the three manage to lose them thanks to Chouchou's intervention.

Boodle wakes up and sets after them himself just as Luffy, Zoro, and Nami leave the island on two small boats, thanking the three from the dock as they sail off. To Nami's surprise, Luffy had deliberately left one of her treasure bags behind that was worth 5,000,000 to help the people of Orange Town rebuild their homes. She warns Luffy never to do that again. With that, the three pirates sail off to continue their journey to the Grand Line.

### __Syrup Village Arc__

#### Island of Rare Animals: The Man in the Treasure Chest[]

The first part of this arc sees the group land on a mysterious island inhabited by strange creatures. After passing the "test" of the forest, the  Straw Hat Pirates (now consisting of  Luffy,  Zoro, and  Nami) meet  Gaimon, a pirate stuck inside a treasure chest who was marooned by his crew 20 years prior. The four become friends, and Luffy agrees to help Gaimon get down the treasure he has been guarding on top of a rock. When Luffy refuses to throw down the treasure chests, Gaimon realizes that the chests on the rock are the same as the island's other treasure chests, which are empty. Seeing Gaimon is disappointed, Luffy offers to take him off the island. However, Gaimon decides to remain on the island and protect its rare animals, which have become his friends. With that, the Straw Hats bid Gaimon goodbye and continue on.

#### Pirates are Coming! The Liar and the Deceiver[]

The Straw Hats arrive in  Syrup Village, where they meet  Usopp, who entertains notions of grandeur by commanding the  Usopp Pirates. This group is composed of Usopp and three loyal village children:  Tamanegi,  Ninjin, and  Piiman. The Usopp Pirates cause no real trouble, but frequently annoy the villagers, most often by giving false warnings of attacking pirates.

Usopp's wealthy friend  Kaya is bedridden, but is well-provided for by her two butlers,  Merry and Klahadore. However, Klahadore hides a dangerous secret: he is actually the evil captain  Kuro, leader of the  Black Cat Pirates. Though Kuro was believed to have been executed years ago, in reality an impostor was switched to take his place. The real Kuro has since been undercover, working to acquire the villagers' respect and Kaya's assets so he can have a peaceful retirement.

The Straw Hats make a stop at Syrup Village in search of a ship. Usopp is overjoyed to have real pirates arrive, and greets them with a cleverly-conceived act designed to fool the pirates into believing he is the commander of his own huge pirate fleet. The ruse fails, and Luffy and friends proceed into Syrup Village unhindered. Soon, the Straw Hats become friends with Usopp when Luffy discovers he is the son of  Yasopp, one of the pirates in  Shanks' crew.

Kuro's long awaited time to act arrives as he meets with his former first mate  Jango, but his identity and plan is accidentally overheard by Luffy and Usopp. Jango hypnotizes Luffy to fall sleep, who then falls off a cliff and is believed to be dead by everyone present. However, they are unaware that Luffy has survived because of his  Devil Fruit powers.

Kuro allows Usopp to flee because no one would believe him, which proves to be true as the villagers choose not to believe his warnings. When Usopp tries to warn Kaya, she thinks that he is trying to kidnap her. Merry, armed with a gun, chases him off. Usopp then lies to his crew in order to protect them from harm. However, the Straw Hats are aware of the situation, and decide to lend aid to Usopp and Kaya and prepare by setting up traps. That night, Merry gives Klahadore a pair of glasses that Kaya bought for his three years of service, only for Klahadore to destroy them and reveal his true intentions of taking Kaya's estate, before attacking Merry to prevent him from warning her. Kuro's ship and crew will arrive at Syrup Village the next day, where they believe they will find no resistance.

#### Hold the Hill: Battle Against the Black Cat Pirates[]

The Straw Hats initially get which beach the Black Cat pirates are going to land on wrong. This is caused by Usopp's faulty assumption that the area where Kuro met Jango was the arrival point, unaware that the real landing point is on the other beach. This results in Usopp and Nami initially fighting the pirates alone, as Luffy gets lost on the way there and Zoro is stuck in their oil slick trap as a result of Nami using him to get out of it herself in a desperate attempt to make sure the Black Cat Pirates don't get to her treasure, which is on the other beach where their boats are.

Just before the two could be killed, Zoro and Luffy arrive and fight  Kuro's crew. Jango hypnotizes the crew to increase their strength, but accidentally hypnotizes Luffy as well, turning him into even more of a threat. Jango is forced to hypnotize Luffy to sleep again to stop him, but accidentally causes the crew to be knocked out by the ship's stempost, which Luffy was holding onto when he fell asleep. Meanwhile, Kaya finds the wounded Merry, who informs her of Klahadore's identity, and, realizing she was wrong about her accusations against Usopp, heads out to find Kuro and talk to him. Usopp's crew figures out that his earlier lie about a pirate attack was actually a lie. They notice Kaya walking out of the village and begin to follow her.

Meanwhile, Jango summons the ship's guards, the Nyaban brothers,  Buchi and  Sham, who fight against Zoro. Disarmed of all but one sword, Zoro fights an uphill battle against the teamwork of Buchi and Sham, which is difficult without all three of his swords. Zoro prevents Usopp from helping him by taking a hit from Usopp's Lead Star to keep him from getting dragged into the fight. Kuro then appears and, disgusted by how the Black Cat Pirates are getting beaten by children, gives the Nyaban brothers five minutes before he kills everyone.

Nami is able to kick Zoro's swords back to him, allowing him to defeat the Nyaban brothers. However, Buchi survives and is hypnotized by Jango, turning him into an even bigger threat to Zoro. Nami goes to wake Luffy up, and Jango tries to stop her with his chakram; but at the last second Nami steps on Luffy's face, which gets him up in time to stop the chakram with his rubber body. Kaya then intervenes, holds Kuro at gunpoint, and tries to get him to remember the fun times they had. However, Kuro reveals that he never cared about her and only wants her money, waiting for this day where he can kill her. This causes Kaya to drop the gun in shock. Usopp tries to attack Kuro to defend Kaya, but Kuro injures him badly in retaliation. Kuro is then attacked by Usopp's crew, who have arrived, but he simply brushes off their attack.

Usopp orders his crew to take Kaya and flee. The three boys take Kaya into the forest while Kuro sends Jango after them. Zoro finishes Buchi off and then heads out with Usopp on his back as a guide to rescue Kaya and the boys (since Usopp cannot move due to his injuries and Zoro needs him to navigate through the forest). Meanwhile, Luffy begins his battle with Kuro. Jango eventually catches up with his target and easily overpowers the boys. Kaya threatens to kill herself with Jango's chakram to stop him from hurting Usopp's crew and allows Jango to force her to sign a will that would allow Kuro to "legally" acquire her wealth after he kills her. Zoro and Usopp catch up, where the latter proves himself less useless than he seems, as Usopp defeats Jango using his sniper skills with help from Zoro, rescuing Kaya and the boys.

Meanwhile, Kuro unleashes his " Shakushi" that attacks everything in sight, including his own men, revealing that part of his original plan was to kill his crew so his true identity could never be exposed. Angered by Kuro's lack of respect for his crew, and his abandoning of the ideal of what it means to be a pirate, the final victory is won by Luffy, who defeats him with his devastating Gomu Gomu no Kane and forces the Black Cat Pirates to leave the village with Kuro's body.

#### From Play Pirate to Real Pirate: The Straw Hats Depart[]

Usopp decides that news of a real pirate attack might be too upsetting for the villagers and would affect their peace of mind, since pirates do not normally come to an out-of-the-way village. He orders everyone to keep it a secret, to which Kaya and his crew agree. Kaya, realizing that her confinement in her home and her sorrow towards her parents' deaths had been the cause of her illness, is grateful to the Straw Hats and gives them her ship, the  Going Merry. Usopp is grateful to them as well, and now has the confidence to disband his pirate crew and strike out on his own to become a real pirate. But his luck proves to be even better than he knows when Luffy invites him to join his crew. With a new friend and crewmember, as well as a new ship, the Straw Hat Pirates leave Syrup Village to continue their voyage to the Grand Line.

### __Baratie Arc__

#### Paying Dues: Of Bounty Hunters, Cooks, and Pirates[]

The  Straw Hat Piratesâ Luffy,  Zoro,  Nami, and the newly-joined  Usoppâchecked out their new pirate ship, the  Going Merry, as well as designed a  Jolly Roger for it. As a test of the ship's capabilities, Luffy and Usopp tested out one of the cannons on board by shooting at a rock formation. However, unbeknownst to them, two pirate hunters happened to be on the rock, and one of them attacked the ship in retaliation. Luffy fought him, but Zoro pointed him out to be a friend of his. The two bounty hunters were  Johnny and  Yosaku. After the Straw Hats apologized and Nami cured Yosaku of his scurvy, the crew realized that they were going to need a cook for the ship to maintain the healthy quality of their food stores before they could go to the  Grand Line. To repay the favor for helping them, Johnny and Yosaku told the crew of a floating restaurant in the middle of the ocean where they might find a cook, helpfully navigating the crew to the aforementioned restaurant, the  Baratie.

Upon their arrival, the group ran into trouble with a  Marine Lieutenant named  Fullbody. In the scuffle between the two, Luffy accidentally redirected a cannonball into the Baratie's roof. Luffy tried to make a deal with the captain, head chef, and owner of the ship,  Zeff, to pay for the damages caused to the roof. Meanwhile, the assistant chef,  Sanji, had an encounter with Fullbody as well and almost killed Fullbody for insulting the Baratie's food. A pirate named  Gin, a member of  Don Krieg's armada who was being detained by Fullbody, came onto the ship demanding food. Although denied food, beaten, and thrown out of the restaurant by the crew, Sanji secretly served the man a savory meal, saving Gin from starvation. Despite this act of kindness, when Gin left and returned to his ship, he told Don Krieg about the Baratie. After hearing about the ship, Don Krieg came to believe that taking over the Baratie was a key step in resurrecting his fleet.

Eventually, Krieg came to the restaurant under the pretense that he would not hurt anyone if he received some food. Of course, once he had eaten, Krieg attacked the cooks onboard and claimed the Baratie as his own, since his original ship and his entire fleet were destroyed seven days into the Grand Line by a mysterious figure. Just as important, his crew was on the verge of death from starvation. Surprisingly, Zeff gave a sack of food to Krieg and warned his cooks about the upcoming battle.

#### Zoro's Ambition: The Ultimate Armada and the Ultimate Swordsman[]

In the midst of the battle, Luffy (who had been working as "Chore Boy" to pay off the damages to the roof) and the other Straw Hats tried to get the Going Merry away from the battle. Only then did they realize that Nami had double-crossed them and stole their ship and treasure, with Zoro, Usopp, Johnny, and Yosaku preparing to go after her. However, their plans were brought to a halt when Krieg's galleon was suddenly sliced in half. Through the wreckage of the ship sailed the mysterious figure that Zoro instantly recognized as  Dracule "Hawk-Eyes" Mihawk, one of the  Seven Warlords of the Sea and the greatest swordsman in the world. Zoro decided to try and defeat Mihawk to gain the title of greatest swordsman in the world, but was clearly outmatched by Mihawk's strength.

However, Zoro impressed Mihawk with his courage and honor. As a result, Mihawk spared Zoro's life so that he could become a better swordsman and face him again someday. After the loss, Zoro vowed never to lose again before setting off with the other Straw Hats to go after Nami. Luffy stayed behind to help the Baratie, with Zeff accepting Luffy's request for his debt to be repaid as the reward for his assistance against the  Krieg Pirates. With that, Mihawk departed, and Krieg directed his attention back to the Baratie.

#### Defend the Baratie: The Chef and the Chore Boy's Battles[]

The Baratie raised its battle fins, which protect the restaurant portion of the Baratie, as the cooks and the Krieg Pirates began to fight. The cooks found that Krieg's pirates were not pushovers, and the battle was not going well for the cooks, until Sanji joined the fray. However, the tide turned back in Krieg's favor when his second mate, "Iron Wall"  Pearl, arrived. At first, Sanji had the upper hand, but after Pearl nearly burned down the ship, Gin was forced to hold Zeff at gunpoint to keep Sanji from fighting back, allowing Pearl to thrash Sanji around.

Sanji thinks back to when he was younger, onboard the passenger ship,  Orbit, where he served as a cook in training. There, other cooks debate on the existence of the  All Blue, a legendary sea where fishes from all the seas of the world can be found in one place. The cooks eat leftovers in the kitchen and are reprimanded by Sanji, telling them that the food was going bad. Suddenly, a  pirate crew captained by Zeff boards their ship.

Before the pirates can finish looting the passenger ship, Sanji was thrown off the Orbit by a huge wave. He was saved by Zeff with him breaking off the ship's mast to be used to float to safety. There being a storm, both ships are sunk. The two end up stranded on a small island where it's impossible to fish for food due to the island's topography. The food from the wreckage is rationed, and both agreed to look out for a ship to save them from different parts of the island.

Seventy days passed and Sanji's famished. He went to steal Zeff's food. However, Sanji discovered that Zeff gave all the food to him and driven by hunger, Zeff cut off his right leg to eat while waiting for rescue. Zeff told Sanji that he saved him because they shared the same dream, which was to find the All Blue. But since he could no longer go and search for it, he would build a restaurant in the sea instead. On the eightieth day, they were rescued.

Back to the Baratie, Gin surprisingly saved Sanji from Pearl, claiming he wanted to kill the cook himself. The two fought briefly, but with Sanji still injured from his fight with Pearl, Gin gained the upper hand. However, Gin could not bring himself to kill Sanji, which infuriated Krieg. As a result, he tried to kill Gin with a poison gas grenade known as MH5, which Gin barely survived. This act upset Luffy, who attacked Krieg and had a long fight on the wreckage of Krieg's ship.

Krieg used everything in his armor's arsenal to try to kill Luffy. However, Luffy countered and powered though each weapon, finally finishing off Krieg by slamming him into the side of the Baratie with his legs, although Krieg did not stay down until a final punch in the gut by Gin stopped him in his tracks. Krieg's final attack with his iron net sent Luffy into the ocean. Sanji saved Luffy from the ocean, and Gin and the rest of Krieg's pirates sailed away on a small dinghy.

#### Keep Your Feet Dry: Sanji Joins the Straw Hats[]

Zeff and his cooks tried to persuade Sanji to leave by telling him a soup he cooked tasted awful. Sanji almost fell for it, but then overheard them when they actually said it tasted delicious. He remembered his dream of finding the All Blue and finally agreed to join Luffy's crew. Just as he made his decision, Yosaku returned, traveling on a panda shark, and warned Luffy that Nami was heading toward a dangerous island. Zeff and the Baratie cooks all gave Sanji a tearful send-off before he, Luffy, and Yosaku headed out to catch up with the others.

### __Arlong Park Arc__

#### A Town Under Siege: In Pursuit of Nami[]

The arc begins following the end of the Baratie Arc, with Luffy, Sanji, and Yosaku heading for  Arlong Park on a  small boat. To pass the time, Yosaku tells them about the  Seven Warlords of the Sea and how this relates to their current destination. When Sanji doubts that Nami is heading there, Yosaku explains that they were able to estimate her course after he and Johnny had suspected the connection between the two before they were thrown off the Going Merry. The two had noticed that Nami had been interested in their copy of Arlong's wanted poster, and her behavior quickly became suspicious when they told her that Arlong recently had become more active. Meanwhile, Nami arrives at Arlong Park in the Going Merry. Once she arrives at the park's gate, a boy confronts her, trying to fight Arlong for the death of his father. Nami slaps him and gives him some money to make him leave. After this, Arlong and his crew are introduced, and it is revealed that Nami is part of Arlong's pirates.

Zoro, Usopp, and Johnny arrive at the island, with the latter two tying up Zoro to prevent him from immediately fighting the Fish-Men. Seeing that two Fish-Men have spotted them, Usopp and Johnny abandon ship, leaving Zoro to be captured by them. They soon find themselves in the remains of  Gosa Village,Â with all the houses upturned. One of the Fish-Men from earlier spots the two and starts chasing them. Johnny manages to escape and hide, while Usopp ends up getting attacked by the same boy from earlier, who had mistaken him for a Fish-Man. However, a woman manages to stop him. Seeing the real Fish-Man getting closer, Usopp readies to fight him, but gets knocked out by the woman, who claims it is not a good idea to fight one of the Fish-Men.

Meanwhile, Luffy, Sanji, and Yosaku continue sailing, and just as they take a break to eat, they encounter a giant  sea cowÂ that is attracted to their food. Luffy punches it at first, prompting Sanji to reprimand him for it; but when he realizes the sea cow sees them as food, he quickly subdues it with one kick. The three then strap the boat to the sea cow and use it to tow them to the island.

Meanwhile, Usopp awakens in the woman's house, who introduces herself as  Nojiko. After convincing the boy to give up on his quest for vengeance, Nojiko reveals to Usopp that she is Nami's foster sister and the island is her hometown, as well as Nami being part of Arlong's crew. Usopp then panics after he realizes what he has gotten Zoro into. Meanwhile, Zoro is brought to Arlong Park, where he finds out about Nami's allegiance to Arlong. After some banter, in which Arlong proudly states that Nami is the type of person who would betray even her own family for the sake of riches (which visibly disturbs her), Zoro throws himself into the water to test Nami's allegiance. She saves Zoro but beats him to reassure the Fish-Men that she is still part of Arlong's crew.

#### A Mother's Love: The Navigator's Tragedy[]

Arlong then heads to  Cocoyasi Village, where he confronts  Genzo, the village sheriff, for simply collecting a new weapon. It is here that Nojiko reveals to Usopp, both of whom are watching, about the monthly fee the villagers have to pay Arlong in order to survive. Just as Arlong is about to kill Genzo, Usopp saves him. He runs as some of the Fish-Men come after him, while the others drag Arlong off before he goes berserk. Nami arrives sometime later, but the villagers treat her coldly and leave, save for Nojiko and Genzo. The two sisters later visit the grave site of Nami's adoptive mother,  Bell-mÃ¨re, where Nami reveals she is almost finished paying Arlong's fee to buy back Cocoyasi.

At Arlong Park, Zoro has busted free from the dungeon (with help from Nami, who cut his bonds) and defeated all the Fish-Men. He meets the octopus Fish-ManÂ  Hatchan, who is oblivious of what happened at the park, and, thinking Zoro is a corrupt  Marine, tows him to Cocoyasi. However, after landing, he overhears some villagers talk about Usopp's attack on the Fish-Men and quickly tries to rush back to the park to save him. However, it is already too late, as the Fish-Men have captured Usopp and threaten to kill him. Nami happens upon the scene and threatens to kill Usopp herself. Usopp tries to get away with a smoke bomb, but Nami intercepts him, stabbing him with a knife, before kicking him into the ocean to drown. This convinces Arlong and the Fish-Men that she is indeed one of them, while from afar Johnny looks on in horror.

Luffy's group finally arrives on the island and runs into Zoro, before Johnny arrives and tells the group what happened to Usopp. Nami soon meets them and reminds Luffy that she just partnered up with him for the treasure, as she tells the group to take their ship back and get off the island. Luffy refuses, causing Nami to angrily walk away. Johnny and Yosaku also split off, not wanting to be killed by the Fish-Men. At this moment, Usopp is shown to be alive and well, as Nami had stabbed her hand instead of him and he merely fainted. He comes across Luffy and the others and tells them what really happened. Nojiko finds the four and agrees to tell them the reason behind Nami's motives. Though Luffy and Zoro do not hear it, Sanji and Usopp (as well as an eavesdropping Johnny and Yosaku) listen to the story of Nami's past.

When Nami was a little girl, she and her older sister Nojiko lived with their adoptive mother, Bell-mÃ¨re. Although they were poor, they were happy, before Arlong came. Upon his arrival, he demanded that the citizens of the island pay him for their lives - 100,000 per adult, and 50,000 per child. Needless to say, Bell-mÃ¨re could not pay this fee, only being able to come up with 100,000. And, although the two little girls were hiding, she decided to sacrifice her own life so that they could live freely. Arlong agreed to Bell-mÃ¨re's terms, and killed her in front of the two little girls. Not only that, but Arlong decided to take Nami with him, deciding her cartography skills would be useful. Later, Nojiko found Nami at Bell-mÃ¨re's grave as she revealed to Nojiko that she made a deal with Arlong to buy back Cocoyasi Village for 100,000,000.

Back in the present, Marine forces led by  Captain  Nezumi land on the island. Nezumi has Genzo take him to Nami and Nojiko's household, where he accuses Nami of harboring illegal money. Nami tries to stop them, but the Marines find the money. Genzo reveals to the Marines that the money is for the repurchase of the town, admitting to a startled Nami that he and the townspeople always knew what she was doing after she "joined" Arlong. Nami tries to prevent the Marines from taking the money, but fails. Nojiko is also shot in the stomach when she tries to protect her. Nami runs back to Arlong and accuses him of sending the Marines to look for her money. However, Arlong denies it, claiming he never broke their deal, before telling her that if she wants her village back, she will just need to start again from scratch. Nami runs off as he laughs.

Back in the village, Genzo rallies the villagers, wanting to attack Arlong for going back on the deal he and Nami brokered. Nami tries to halt them, but their minds are set as they head for Arlong Park. A furious and upset Nami stabs herself in the arm where Arlong's tattoo is, only to be stopped by Luffy. After his interruption, Nami finally asks for his help. He places his straw hat on her and agrees. With that, Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, and Sanji head for Arlong Park.

#### Helping a Friend: Straw Hat Pirates vs. Arlong Pirates[]

Johnny and Yosaku, who tried to take on Arlong and failed, stop the villagers at the gate, telling them to wait for "those guys" to show up (referring to the  Straw Hats). When the crew arrives, Luffy breaks down the door and slugs Arlong for making Nami cry. The rest of the Fish-Men attack, along with  Momoo, the sea cow from earlier. However, Luffy dispatches them by grabbing Momoo and spinning him around like a pinwheel using his rubber powers. This leaves Arlong and his three subordinates,Â  Hatchan,  Chew, and  Kuroobi,Â the only ones left standing. The last attack, however, leaves Luffy's feet stuck in the ground, which Arlong notices and takes advantage of by uprooting the gravel around Luffy's legs and throwing him into the ocean, proclaiming that it is a "game" and the other Straw Hats must beat the Fish-Men to save Luffy. Zoro takes on Hatchan despite his wound and a fever, and manages to win against Hatchan's Six Sword Style with help from Johnny and Yosaku.

Sanji fights Kuroobi, but is nearly defeated when he goes into the water to rescue Luffy. However, seeing that Nojiko and Genzo are helping Luffy, Sanji brings Kuroobi up to dry land and defeats him. Meanwhile, Usopp fights Chew outside of Arlong Park. At first, he fakes his defeat so Chew will leave him alone. However, remembering the others fighting for Nami's sake, Usopp gains the courage to take him on and eventually defeats Chew by drenching him with alcohol and lighting him on fire, before repeatedly bashing his head with his hammer until he is knocked out.

Nami arrives in the midst of the battle and sides with the villagers to fight against Arlong. Luckily, Nojiko and Genzo revive Luffy and Sanji frees him from the rock on his feet so he can finally fight Arlong one-on-one. A rough battle ensues as Luffy and Arlong trade blows around the park, until Arlong forces Luffy to escape into a room at the top of the tower. Arlong reveals that it is where Nami slaved away making maps for him. When Arlong pronounces that Luffy cannot use Nami the way he can, this proves to be the turning point as Luffy begins to destroy the room that has brought Nami grief through the years (with Nami thanking him as she watches furniture she worked on fall from the tower). Arlong tries to stop him with a final attack, but Luffy takes the attack and smashes Arlong through the tower, finally defeating him and destroying the park in the process.

#### Leaving with a Smile: The Navigator's Last Laugh[]

At first everyone believes Luffy is dead, but he emerges from the wreckage yelling "Nami, you are my friend!!", to which she wholeheartedly agrees. The villagers then celebrate their freedom, though it is almost spoiled by Nezumi, who tries to claim Arlong's money for himself. Some swift beatings from Nami and the rest of the Straw Hats convince him otherwise. Nezumi retreats, swearing revenge against Luffy. He reports Luffy's victory to his Marine base.

In the aftermath, the villagers throw a party celebrating their heroes. Luffy finds Genzo at Bell-mÃ¨re's grave site, where he makes Luffy promise not to take Nami's smile; otherwise, he will hunt him down and kill him himself. Nami gets a new tattoo of a tangerine and a pinwheel merged to replace her Arlong one. The next day, Johnny and Yosaku bid the Straw Hats farewell since they are bounty hunters, and it would not look good to be traveling with pirates. As the crew gets ready to leave, they realize Nami has not arrived yet. Nami then yells for them to cast off as she runs for the docks. The confused villagers try to stop her so they can say goodbye, but she runs past them and jumps onto the ship. She pulls up her shirt to reveal that she stole all the villagers' wallets as she ran past, causing all of them to yell "you little brat!" Despite their disbelief and anger, they wave goodbye to her and the Straw Hats as they leave the island.

As she watches them go, Nojiko realizes Genzo is not wearing the pinwheel he once wore on his hat to make Nami laugh when she was a baby and to make her feel better as she grew up. When asked, Genzo tells Nojiko that he doesn't need it anymore. The scene then changes to reveal the pinwheel on Bell-mÃ¨re's grave as the Going Merry sails off to the  Grand Line.

### __Loguetown Arc__

#### Luffy's First Bounty: The Town of Beginnings and Endings[]

The arc starts off with the Straw Hats lounging around on the  Going Merry's deck when a flyer slips out of the newspaper  Nami is reading, showing the 30,000,000 bounty on  Monkey D. Luffy's head. Luffy is more than overjoyed with it, though Nami tells him it will mean more stress for the crew now that people will be after him.  Zoro then spots an island, which Nami points out to be Loguetown, the last stop in the  East Blue before the Grand Line, as well as the birth and deathplace of the famous pirate, Gold Roger. The crew decides to stop off there to grab supplies.

Meanwhile, the bounty poster reaches Luffy's hometown. The villagers are more than happy that Luffy is fulfilling his dream, though the mayor,  Woop Slap, who has always been against Luffy becoming a pirate, thinks it is more like destiny than a dream. Meanwhile,  Dracule Mihawk also delivers the poster to  Shanks, who celebrates Luffy's coming with a party.

#### New and Old Faces: White Hunter Smoker and Buggy the Clown[]

Back in Loguetown, Zoro, while shopping for new swords to replace the ones Mihawk destroyed, has his first meeting with  Tashigi, who, much to Zoro's unease, bears an uncanny resemblance to his old friend,  Kuina. Tashigi helps him pick out new swords, identifying one as  Sandai Kitetsu after Zoro chooses it. The shop's owner,  Ipponmatsu, refuses to sell the sword to Zoro, pointing out the curse associated with it. Zoro decides to test his luck against the blade's curse, holding out his arm as he throws it in the air. Surprisingly, the blade circles around his arm and lands without cutting it off. Out of respect for Zoro's luck and skill, Ipponmatsu allows him to keep the blade, before also giving him  Yubashiri, the family heirloom and the best sword in his shop.

While this is going on,  Sanji buys a gigantic fish for the crew;  Usopp purchases some more supplies, ammo, and new goggles; and Nami gets a bundle of clothes. Luffy, meanwhile, goes to check the execution stand where Gold Roger was executed. While he climbs and admires the view from the stand, a woman calls out to him, seemingly recognizing Luffy, though he has no idea who she is. When part of the fountain in the town square breaks off and hits her, the debris just slides right off her body. She reveals herself to be  Alvida, the first pirate Luffy came across on his journey. Only now, she has eaten the  Sube Sube no Mi, causing her figure to change dramatically. She is not alone either, as another familiar pirate makes himself known:  Buggy.  Cabaji ambushes Luffy on the platform and puts him in shackles, while Buggy's pirates hold the town square hostage. Buggy declares that this is Luffy's execution.

At the  Marine base in town, one of the men reports to his captain about the pirate ongoings in town. It is here we meet Captain  Smoker, who has a reputation of never letting a pirate leave his town uncaptured, as he decides to wait for Luffy to be executed before moving in. The rest of the Straw Hats also get wind of what's going on and split up, with Zoro and Sanji going to rescue Luffy, while Nami and Usopp ready the ship to leave, as Nami has detected a storm approaching the island.

#### The Unexpected Rescue: Enter Dragon[]

Zoro and Sanji reach the execution area and try to fight their way through Buggy's pirates, but it doesn't look like they will make it as Buggy begins to bring his sword down on Luffy's head. With all seeming lost, Luffy smiles and tells his two friends that it looks like the end for him. However, a bolt of lightning hits Buggy's sword at the last second, destroying the platform and freeing Luffy with not a scratch on him as he, Zoro, and Sanji then make for the Going Merry. Smoker, who was watching, seems disturbed that Luffy laughed in the face of death, realizing that it was very similar to Gold Roger before he was executed.

Buggy, his crew, and Alvida, after recovering from the shock, try to make their escape, but are quickly defeated by Smoker and captured by the Marines. Nami and Usopp reach the Going Merry and quickly take down  Mohji and his lion  Richie, who were trying to burn down the ship.

The other Straw Hats also run into opposition in the form of Tashigi, angry that Zoro "tricked" her, causing him to stay behind and fight her. Smoker confronts Luffy and Sanji, who are unable to strike him due to his  Devil Fruit powers.

However, the two are saved by a  mysterious figure, allowing Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji to reach the ship unhindered. Smoker and Tashigi decide to abandon their posts to chase after them. Meanwhile, Buggy and his crew, who managed to escape the Marines during the fighting, decide to also head for the  Grand Line to pursue Luffy.

#### The Journey Continues: To the Grand Line![]

With the storm guiding them and a lighthouse in sight, the Going Merry is soon nearing its long-awaited destination. As the ship nears the entrance to the Grand Line, the Straw Hats perform a "ceremony" of sorts by placing one foot on a barrel and reciting their dream: Sanji to find the All Blue, Luffy to become the Pirate King, Zoro to become the world's strongest swordsman, Nami to draw a world map, and Usopp to become a brave warrior of the sea.

## Arabasta Saga

### __Reverse Mountain Arc__

#### Sailing Upward: A Giant Whale and a Mysterious Duo[]

As the Straw Hats sail through a storm,  Nami realizes that they will be going up  Reverse Mountain to access the  Grand Line. The crew expresses disbelief at the idea, with  Zoro wondering why they can't just go south. Suddenly, the storm stops, and Nami reveals that they are in the  Calm Belt, one of two strips of ocean surrounding the Grand Line, where there are no winds or currents. Nami urges the crew to row back to the storm, but the  Sea Kings infesting the water then rise up. The Straw Hats struggle to get away, and once they escape, they turn their attention to successfully riding the dangerous current up Reverse Mountain. Their rudder soon breaks, but Luffy shields the  Going Merry from hitting the mountain as the Straw Hats successfully sail down into the Grand Line.

When they come down, they immediately run into a giant whale named  Laboon, who is blocking their path. The Merry ends up running into the whale, which breaks its masthead. Luffy punches Laboon in the eye in retaliation for his seat being destroyed. Laboon then opens his mouth, swallowing the Going Merry, although Luffy manages to escape. Luffy tries hitting Laboon to get his friends out, but before the whale dives underwater, he spots and enters a trapdoor on the whale's back. Meanwhile, the other Straw Hats find themselves sailing towards an island inside Laboon. They soon encounter a giant squid, which is taken down by a man named  Crocus. After an initially tense confrontation, Crocus points them toward an escape route.

Right then, Laboon begins ramming himself into Reverse Mountain, causing further injuries to his head. As this happens, two mysterious people named  Mr. 9 and  Miss Wednesday prepare to take Crocus outÂ to Laboon and use him to feed the people of their town. However, Luffy is sent tumbling through the corridors by Laboon's thrashing, and he endsÂ up crashing into Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday, sending them flying into the area where the Straw Hats and Crocus were. Crocus went to calmÂ Laboon downÂ before confronting the two rogues and took two bazooka shots aimed at Laboon asÂ Luffy defeatsÂ the rogues. They returnÂ to Crocus' island, where Crocus explained about Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday to the Straw Hats. He then revealed that Laboon had come to the Grand Line with a pirate crew and was asked to stay with him at Reverse Mountain as the crew could not risk taking the whale with them. Over 50 years had passed since then, but Laboon still believed that the crew would come back. The Straw Hats exited Laboon's body and threw Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday into the water. The two agents swore revenge on the pirates before swimming away. At  Twin Cape, Crocus revealed that he had heard that the crew with Laboon had not died, but rather had left the Grand Line. He told this to Laboon, but the whale seemed to refuse to believe him and started ramming his head against Reverse Mountain, as though trying to get to the crew.

Right then, Luffy took the Merry's mast and plunged it into one of Laboon's open wounds, causing the whale to lash out against him. The two traded blows, and Luffy proclaimed that he was now Laboon's rival, promising to see and fight him again once his crew sailed around the Grand Line. This made Laboon happy, and Luffy painted his  Jolly Roger on the whale's forehead, telling him not to bash his head against the mountain any longer. Meanwhile, Nami was shocked as her compass stopped working. Crocus tells Nami thatÂ to navigate the Grand Line, one would need a  Log Pose to chart the differing magnetic fields of each island, all the way to the last island  Laugh Tale. Luffy had acquired a Log Pose that Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday had left on the Merry, but it ended up breaking when he and Sanji got in a fight. However, Crocus agreed to give them a Log Pose out of gratitude for helping Laboon.

Meanwhile, Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday swam up to the Twin Cape to try to get their Log Pose back, as they needed to get back to their island and report to their boss before they got into trouble. However, the  Unluc kies then came to try and kill them. After recovering from the attack, the two rogues went to the Straw Hats and asked them to take them to  Whisky Peak. They were unable to divulge their identities, but the Straw Hats reluctantly agreed to help. They then set sail for Whisky Peak, bidding farewell to Crocus and Laboon, and Crocus wondered if Luffy was the one he and  Roger had been waiting for.

### __Whisky Peak Arc__

#### A Welcome for Pirates: The Town of Assassins[]

The arc begins with the Straw Hat Crew out in the ocean in the starting leg of the Grand Line. They are quickly introduced to the abnormality of the place, as they experience the ever-changing weather and tides, which constantly keep the crew (save for a sleeping Zoro) on their toes. Eventually, the weather stabilizes and the crew spots  an island on the horizon, and on it, the town Whisky Peak. Upon reaching the town,  Mr. 9 and  Miss Wednesday thank the crew and jump ship, much to the crew's confusion. Since the Log Pose needs time to reset, the crew have no choice but to dock at the mysterious island. Much to their surprise, the residents welcome them as if they are heroes. Soon they meet the town's leader,  Igarappoi,Â who treats them to a party.

The crew quickly takes to the place, eating, drinking, and flirting (in Sanji and Usopp's case) into the night, until eventually they all fall asleep. However, Igarappoi, as well as a few otherÂ operatives in disguise, turn out to be agents of the elusiveÂ criminal syndicate,Â  Baroque Works, but both  Zoro and  Nami had faked passing out, thwarting their surprise attack. This syndicate operates only with the assignmentsÂ delegated to its agents by the leader, who, like every other member with the number agent status, remains secret and anonymous. When the town bounty hunters, theÂ  Millions,Â are discovered, they hunt and attempt to murder Zoro who, without much effort, picks them off little by little, leaving an anxious  Mr. 8, Mr. 9,  Miss Monday,Â and Miss Wednesday to be dealt with.

Zoro is then ambushed again by other bounty hunters, but quickly dispatches them, before overpowering Miss Monday. He is then faced by Mr. 8, Mr. 9, and Miss Wednesday; the latter tries to hypnotize and attack Zoro, but she misses because of her mount,  Karoo. After escaping Mr. 8, Zoro is found by Mr. 9, who restrains Zoro's left arm using an iron wire. Miss Wednesday then shows up holding Luffy hostage, but is then hit by Mr. 9, after Zoro uses him as a shield for Mr. 8's attack. Zoro then brings the final hit on Mr. 8, defeating him.

#### The Secret Organization: Baroque Works Strikes[]

Soon after,  Mr. 5 and his lady partner  Miss Valentine arrive, but are not present to aid the other, less capable agents of the organization. They reveal that the leader of Baroque Works ( Mr. 0) has discovered a spy, who has somehow successfully infiltrated the ranks, and that they have been sent to eliminate them.

The spies are none other than  Igaram (Mr. 8, who used the alias Igarappoi as the town's leader) and Princess  Nefertari Vivi (Miss Wednesday) of the  Arabasta kingdom. Mr. 9 and Ms. Monday, despite being rather unaware of the situation to their own admission, decide to hold off the Mr. 5 pair so that Vivi can escape, but are swiftly defeated.

In a twist of fate, the pirates that Vivi was meant to kill in her role as a double agent are now her protectors, when Igaram promises Nami 1,000,000,000 to ensure her safety back to Arabasta. Zoro comes to Vivi's rescue, however,  Luffy arrives at the scene and attacks him, mistakenly believing that the townsfolk Zoro killed were actually friendly. After fighting for a bit, they unintentionally defeat the pair of agents and stop fighting when they are smacked by Nami.

At this point, Vivi explains that her kingdom is falling to ruin,Â asÂ a civil war has been devised by Baroque Works, and thatÂ if she can confront the rebel army with the information on the true cause of the war, she can end it. The leader of Baroque Works, according to her, wants to take over Arabasta and turn it into an "ideal nation" ruled by him, and she revealsÂ the leader to beÂ  Crocodile of the  Seven Warlords of the Sea. Unfortunately, by revealing his name, Luffy, Zoro, and Nami are added to the Baroque Works hit list by the nearby  Mr. 13, causing Nami to throttle her. Afterwards, Igaram appears dressed as Vivi and explains that he will act as a decoy. He departs from Whisky Peak, only to have his ship be blown up as soon as he leaves, seemingly killing him.

The Straw Hats and Vivi run to the  Going Merry only to find  Miss All Sunday, the highest ranking female Baroque Works agent, waiting for them. As it turns out, she was the one who let Vivi find out the boss's identity, yet she was also the one who revealed that she and Igaram were double agents and blew up the ship, so the crew is unsure of whatÂ side she is on. Ms. All Sunday gives them an  Eternal Pose (a permanent Log Pose) to  Nanimonai Island, which is supposedly very close to Arabasta, but Luffy destroys it, claiming that she does not decide their course. As Ms. All Sunday leaves, the crew leave for  Little Garden, the next island of the Grand Line.

### __Little Garden Arc__

#### An Ancient Land: The Grand Duel Between Giants[]

With a newly acquired  Princess Vivi on board, the  Straw Hats soon find themselves on the island of  Little Garden, which is a misnomer as the island is anything but little. It is stuck in a prehistoric time and teeming with huge dinosaurs and massive plant life. While  Usopp and  Nami feel uncomfortable leaving the ship, Vivi and  Luffy decide to go explore the island.

They soon meet  Dorry, a giant warrior from  Elbaf who befriends them. A little while later,  Sanji and  Zoro get into a fight about who could get the most meat first. They soon leave the ship in search of animals they can use to win the bet. Left alone on the ship,  Nami and  Usopp learn why the island is called Little Garden. It is called Little Garden because of those who inhabit it. They are terrified when  Brogy, another giant, shows up and decapitates a tyrannosaurus rex. He decides to bring them home with him, much to their alarm, under the impression he wants to eat them.

#### Baroque Works' Deception: The Mad Artist's Scheme[]

Elsewhere,  Baroque Works agents  Mr. 5,  Miss Valentine,  Mr. 3, and his partner  Miss Goldenweek come together and reveal the 100,000,000 bounty on each of the giant's heads, and it is suggested by Mr. 3 that they kill them, along with the Straw Hats. Back at Dorry's campsite, Dorry explains that he and Brogy are forever destined to continue their one hundred year long war, which was started over a reason Dorry had long forgotten (it is later revealed that it was a quarrel about their hunting competition which resulted in their exile from Elbaf), which inspires Usopp to fight for his dream of being a proud warrior of the sea. When Dorry and Brogy are just about to continue their bout, Dorry suffers internal injuries from an explosion after drinking some of the Straw Hats' beer, which was tampered with by Mr. 5 usingÂ  his Devil FruitÂ abilities. Dorry tries to attack Luffy, thinking he was responsible, but Luffy quickly beats him using Gomu Gomu Rocket by targeting his stomach. Realizing that the god of Elbaf was not on his side, Dorry still decides to go and pins Luffy under a giant rock when Luffy tries to stop Dorry from going to fight Brogy.

Meanwhile, Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek capture Zoro first, and then Nami after she is separated from Usopp while running from a dinosaur. After Usopp meets with Luffy and Vivi, Vivi suspects that Baroque Works is likely behind Nami's disappearance, since out of the two of them, Nami is on their hit list while Usopp is not, and they are also responsible for the exploding beer that injured Dorry. Eventually, Dorry loses to Brogy due to his injuries (as well as Mr. 3 using his wax in secret to make Dorry trip). Brogy notices a deficiency in Dorry's performance but is too late in identifying the perpetrators when Mr. 3 appears and imprisons him with wax. Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine then succeed in capturing Vivi despite failing to use  Karoo to lure her away from Luffy, which they realize they did not need to do since Luffy was imprisoned by the rock, and quickly defeat him,Â Usopp and Karoo.

Mr. 3 then imprisons Zoro, Nami, and Vivi in his giant candle set which will slowly turn them along with Brogy into wax sculptures. Just as Zoro is about to cut off his legs to break free, Luffy, Usopp, and Karoo arrive to save their friends. However, when Luffy damages Mr. 3's giant candelabra after his feet are trapped in the wax, it only accelerates the process, giving Luffy, Usopp, and Karoo less time to save the others. Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine then engage Usopp and Karoo and all the two can do is run away since Usopp's Gunpowder Star is useless against Mr. 5, while Mr. 3 prevents Luffy's further attempts from destroying his candle set.

Luffy is then brought under Miss Goldenweek's hypnotic control. Despite all of Luffy's attempts to free himself from the hypnosis, Miss Goldenweek continues to use her  Colors Trap ability to re-hypnotize Luffy. Eventually, Usopp, as he is dodging Mr. 5's Breath Blast Bomb, realizes the situation and uses his Flame Star to burn Luffy's shirt to free him completely, forcing Mr. 3 to form his mecha-like armor, the Candle Champion, to hold off Luffy. Once Usopp realizes that despite the density Mr. 3 makes his wax, it could still be melted away, and though their friends' bodies have been completely covered, they still have a small amount of time left.

Though the Mr. 5 team takes down Usopp before he can try to shoot the candle set with his Flame Star, Usopp gives Karoo a rope with instructions to run around with it along the candle set. As he is taking the strain from Miss Valentine's weight, Usopp tells Luffy to set the rope (which he soaked with oil) on fire, as it is the only way to melt the wax quickly enough to save their friends. Grabbing onto Mr. 3's hair, Luffy uses the fiery portion of it to light the rope tricking Mr. 3 into melting the wax. Once the candle set is destroyed, Nami and Vivi defeat Miss Valentine. Before Mr. 5 can shoot Vivi, Usopp tricks Mr. 5 into eating his Tabasco Star and is saved by Zoro before an angry Mr. 5 can kill him. Meanwhile, Luffy and Karoo pursue the Mr. 3 team, and though Mr. 3 tries to trick Luffy by creating clone statues of himself, Luffy, through sheer instinct, knocks him out, while Karoo defeats Miss Goldenweek.

#### Keep Moving Forward: Onward to Arabasta[]

Meanwhile, Sanji enjoys tea in Mr. 3's candle house and receives a call from Mr. 0,Â who mistakes him for Mr. 3. He is ordered to go to  Arabasta (later revealed to be a ploy to make assassinating him easier for  Mr. 2Â after Mr. 0 thought he lied about succeeding in his mission to kill Vivi and the Straw Hats) by way of the  Eternal Pose which is being sent by the Unluckies,  Mr. 13 and  Miss Friday, who attack Sanji and are defeated upon making the delivery. Dorry turns out to be okay as he was only knocked out asÂ both his sword and Brogy's axe were dulled from being constantly used over the last century.

Meanwhile, the Marines have intercepted a garbled message in the call between Mr. 0 and Sanji. Smoker is able to make out four key words, "Princess Vivi," "Straw Hats," "Mr. 0," and "orders directly." They were able to capture Mr. 11, a Baroque Works frontier agent and trick him into confirming the existence of a criminal organization headed by Mr. 0. Smoker decides to follow the clues and head for the Kingdom of Arabasta.

Once Sanji returns, Dorry and Brogy bid farewell to the Straw Hats by slaying  Island Eater, a giant goldfish who eats ships leaving the island, sacrificing what remainedÂ of their weapons in the process. With that, the Straw Hats head for Arabasta using the  Eternal Pose they got from the Unluckies.

### __Drum Island Arc__

#### The Island of Doctors and Sickness[]

Nami catches a deadly fever in  Little Garden, forcing the  Straw Hat Pirates to make a detour to the king-less island of Drum. On their way to the island, they are attacked by a group of  pirates led by  Wapol, whose  Baku Baku no Mi allows him to eat anything and assimilate it into himself. After a brief skirmish,  Luffy sends  Wapol flying into the sea and the Straw Hats continue onto  Drum Island. When they land, they are attacked again, this time by Drum Island's militia. However, after hearing about their plight,  Dalton, the former captain of the guard, calls off the attack and leads them to the town of  Bighorn. There, he explains the situation that the island is in.

In the recent past, the island was ruled by a cruel king, Wapol, the pirate the  Straw Hats encountered earlier. Wapol banished all but the 20 best doctors from the island. For any medical treatment, one would have to beg him for the help of one of the remaining doctors, his " Isshi-20" as he called them. However, a powerful pirate named  Blackbeard attacked the country. After witnessing Blackbeard's power,  Wapol and his cabinet, with the exception of  Dalton fled to the sea without even fighting back. Now, there is only one doctor left on the islandâDr.  Kureha, who is often called a witch by the townspeople. She comes into towns at her own whim to check for patients. She lives in  Drum Castle, which is on top of the highest of the " Drum Rockies", a chain of drum shaped mountains.

#### The Reindeer Doctor[]

After learning this,  Luffy and  Sanji head for the mountain with Nami in tow, only to be attacked by dozens of  Lapahns, giant ferocious rabbits. A fight ensues, and its ferocity causes an avalanche. Sanji is injured, so Luffy must climb up the mountain while carrying both Nami and Sanji. When he reaches the top, both his hands and feet are severely damaged. He collapses in front of Dr. Kureha and her assistant,  Tony Tony Chopper.

Meanwhile, Wapol and his crew return to Drum Island and attack a city to announce their presence. Dalton tries to fight them but is defeated. Having done this, Wapol and his crew decide to go back to their old home, Drum Castle. As this is happening, Dr. Kureha and Chopper are curing Nami and caring for Sanji and Luffy, there are a few comedic scenes, mostly involving Sanji and Luffy trying to catch and cook Chopper. Later, Dr. Kureha explains Chopper's tragic past to Sanji and Nami (Luffy was too busy chasing after Chopper trying to convince him to join the crew).

When Chopper was younger, he ate the  Hito Hito no Mi. As a result, and because of his blue nose, the other reindeer would not accept him into their herds. He was an outcast for much of his life. Finally, he found a friend in a Dr.  Hiriluk, a quack doctor that was trying to cure the people of Drum but usually made a mess of things. He found Chopper with bullet wounds in his back. By curing Chopper, he gained Chopper's trust and inspired Chopper to become a doctor. However, their friendship was not to last. Dr. Hiriluk kicked Chopper out of his home, seemingly for no reason. Later, Chopper found out that Dr. Hiriluk was going to die in ten days. Despite his attempts to save him, the good doctor sacrificed him for the sake of Chopper and his country. Since then, he has stayed with Dr. Kureha, and learned the art of doctoring.

#### The Siege of Wapol Castle[]

Eventually, Wapol and his crew arrive at the castle. His senior henchman,  Chess and  Kuromarimo are in tow. Kuromarimo distracts the crew by throwing fuzzy black balls that will not come off of Sanji. This gives Wapol time to get to the armory and devour a cannon. It is then that another trait of the Baku Baku Fruit is revealed - Wapol can become whatever he eats! Wapol's arms turn into a cannon, and he starts shooting at Dr. Hiriluk's flag (his memorial as Kureha puts it). Chopper does not respond so Luffy takes action, standing in front of the cannonballs so they do not damage the flag, effectively thwarting the assault.

Wapol then employs a different strategy, he eats Chess and Kuromimo. Then turns into a house, and a combination of Chess and Kuromarimo emerges -  Chessmarimo! Sanji tries to enter the fight, but Kureha cripples him, by attacking his spine and telling him that he has still not recovered. Chopper finally reacts and fights with Chessmarimo, showing off the skills he gains through his invention, the  Rumble Ball. Using the Rumble Ball he finds Chessmarimo's weakness and defeats him.

Wapol goes into the castle looking to eat more weaponry along the way running into Nami giving chase when he realizes she is a friend of Luffy, when he gets stuck in a stairwell he "eats himself" and emerges skinny before continuing the chase. Luffy finds Nami in time to stop Wapol from killing her, but Wapol escapes. Luffy pursues Wapol, but Wapol reaches a tower which supposedly holds a very powerful and giant cannon called  Royal Drum Crown 7-Shot Bliking Cannon. Wapol attempts to shoot Luffy with it, however while it sat unused during his absence,  Snow Birds made nests in it. As a result, Wapol's attack on Luffy fails. The king then tries to stop Luffy with the cannon he ate earlier, but Luffy dodges it and sends Wapol into the castle's ceiling with his bowgun attack.

Realizing he is outmatched, Wapol frantically begs Luffy to spare him by offering him the position of second king. Luffy does not listen and sends Wapol flying to another island with Gomu Gomu no Bazooka.

#### Cherry Blossoms in the Snow[]

In the aftermath, Luffy continues to try and recruit Chopper to his crew. Chopper, remembering how his old mentor, Dr. Hiriluk, wanted him to go out to sea and see the world, decides to join the Straw Hats. When he goes to tell Kureha this, she flat out refuses to let him leave, chasing after the reindeer with a variety of weapons until Chopper escapes down the mountain with the rest of the Straws Hats on a sled. Turns out however, Kureha's refusal was all an act (or in a way, reverse psychology) to convince Chopper to leave as she does not like tearful goodbyes. Dr. Kureha then has most of the villagers set up cannons pointed into the air and uses the "cure for the country's cold heart" that Dr. Hiriluk had developed before he died, to produce the image of falling cherry-blossoms on the snow, as a sendoff to her beloved student. After witnessing this, the Straw Hats finally set off for Arabasta.

However, in the closing moments of the arc, as Kureha and Dalton are talking, one of the villagers comes to Dalton with Luffy's bounty poster. When Kureha realizes that his full name is Monkey D. Luffy, she reveals that  Gold Roger's full name was actually Gol . Roger and that her student seems to be sailing with a very dangerous man. Also, two of the villagers remember that they had to give Luffy a message from  Ace, a man who was searching for Blackbeard and was going to wait for Luffy in Arabasta for ten days. But since Luffy is gone, they did not have the time to tell him. However, Dalton, who remembered Vivi as Arabasta's princess, knows it is all right since the Straw Hats are bound to encounter Ace in Arabasta.

### __Arabasta Arc__

#### The Man with Many Faces: Mr. 2[]

The  Going Merry is on its way to Arabasta and the crew is trying to catch fish to eat. Vivi explains that Crocodile is seen as a hero in Arabasta and that no one suspects that he plans to take over the kingdom. Suddenly, they steer through a hot spot (an undersea volcano making the sea above steaming hot),  Usopp and  Luffy catch  Mr. 2, who coincidentally took a similar course, on their fishing rods. The crew pulls him up and quickly befriend him, mainly due to how entertaining he is, especially with his ability to transform into other people with the  Mane Mane no Mi. He imitates everybody on the ship except  Sanji, who was cooking at the moment, and  Vivi, who he simply did not touch. Bon Kurei is then picked up by his own ship and crew and leaves, swearing on friendship. Just as they leave, Vivi realizes that he is Mr. 2 of  Baroque Works, but the Straw Hats see it as good fortune to have met him and wear white bandages on their lower arms so they will know if Bon Kurei is imitating one of them.

#### Arriving in Arabasta: The Port Town of Nanohana[]

The port town of  Nanohana in the desert Kingdom of Arabasta is being invaded by pirates. Crocodile, one of the  Seven Warlords of the Sea, arrives and quashes the invasion. The townspeople are grateful and praise him as their hero. The news of the event reaches King Nefertari Cobra, and he says that they are indebted to Crocodile.

Meanwhile, the Straw Hats finally reach Nanohana. Luffy, hungry from the long journey, storms off into town without waiting for his crew. At a bar, he interrupts a confrontation between a man named  Portgas D. Ace and  Captain Smoker of the  Marines, knocking both through the wall without his noticing. Luffy grabs a lot of meat but flees when Smoker stands back up and gives chase. He leads the Marines directly to his crew mates that were purchasing provisions and water in the town. Just as Smoker tries to catch them, Ace interrupts and secures an escape route for the Straw Hat Pirates.

Back on the ship, Luffy tells the crew the man who saved them was his brother. Ace hops onto the ship and meets the crew, but does not stay long and gives Luffy a piece of paper before leaving, destroying seven ships with Billions of the Baroque Works on the way out. Vivi also sends  Karoo with a message to Alubarna to warn the King.

#### The Desert, a Camel, and the Old Man[]

The  Straw Hat Pirates sails to the west side of the  Sandora River (Arabasta's biggest river) delta and anchor, leaving the ship. They encounter a group of  Kung-Fu Dugongs, who challenge the crew only to be beaten up by Luffy. However, the dugongs now want to become his apprentices, forcing  Chopper to bribe them with half their food so they can leave. They enter the town of  Erumalu, formerly also known as the Green City, but is now deserted and destroyed by the sand.

They continue their journey through the desert, and Luffy, while resting in a shadow of a big rock, loses half their stuff to  Warusagi Birds who trick travelers and steal their luggage. He chases after them but returns alongside a camel that is being chased by a gigantic Great  Sandora Lizard. In joined efforts, Sanji,  Zoro and Luffy kill the lizard and cook it. The camel, who happens to be a pervert, is given the name " Matsuge" by  Nami and joins the crew, giving Nami and Vivi (and only them) a ride on his back.

In the meantime, the Officer Agents have gathered in the  Spiders Cafe and are led to  Rainbase for the briefing of their final mission as Baroque Works.

The journey is continued, and the Straw Hats finally arrive in the Yuba Oasis, the supposed hideout of the  Rebel Army. However, the only citizen left in town tells them that the rebels are now in an oasis near Nanohana, for Yuba is now almost a daily target of sandstorms. The old citizen turns out to be an old friend of Vivi's,  Toto. Here, we learn of their past together along with his son and her friend,  Koza, who is currently the leader of the Rebel Army. He gives the Straw Hats a place to sleep and also digs up a gallon of water in the night.

The Straw Hats leave Yuba in the morning as Vivi wants to return to Nanohana, but Luffy becomes gravely serious and tells her that stopping the Rebels will not get rid of Crocodile nor prevent any loss of life and they should go to Rainbase where Crocodile resides. He notes that even if they manage to reach the rebels, Crocodile will still try something to continue the warâit should be noted that, at this point, they still thought there was time before the battles started. After a tough argument and a scuffle in which Luffy states they're all risking their lives, Vivi agrees and leads them to Rainbase.

Meanwhile the Officer Agents of the Baroque Works met up with  Miss All-Sunday and Crocodile in the basement of the  Rain Dinners Casino, owned by Crocodile. They are told the goal of the Baroque Works, their final mission and their respective parts in overthrowing Arabasta. They are interrupted by  Mr. 3, who tells them that the Straw Hats and Vivi have escaped him during their time in  Little Garden. He asks Crocodile for forgiveness, but is fed to his pet  Bananawani (huge crocodiles with banana-shaped growths on their heads) instead. The Officer Agents all get pictures of Vivi and the Straw Hat crew (excluding Sanji) with the help of Bon Kurei's abilities and are given the order to hunt them down (excluding Chopper as Crocodile believed he was the Straw Hats pet).

In  Katorea, the rebels lead by Koza, plan to launch an all-out attack on Alubarna, the capital of Arabasta. The news of this development reaches King Cobra, and his Royal Guards implore him to get ready to fight the Rebel Army. He refuses as he does not want to fight with his own people. Karoo then arrives at the palace and delivers Vivi's letter to the King which informs them of Crocodile's true intention of causing the downfall of Arabasta. The King decides to instead have the Royal Army march on to Rainbase and face Crocodile instead of facing the rebels in order for their country to survive and rebuild.

#### Arriving in Rainbase: Crocodile's Plan Unveiled[]

Upon their arrival in Rainbase, the thirsty Luffy and Usopp rush right into a bar to get water, only to unexpectedly run into Captain Smoker and  Tashigi there (and spit water in their faces from shock). They get chased by the two and their Marine squad, which also draws the attention of the Baroque Works  Billions stationed. The crew splits into groups: Nami and Usopp; Zoro and Vivi; Sanji; Luffy, chased by Smoker; and Chopper, who was left behind. Luffy, Nami, Usopp, Zoro, and Smoker all arrive at Rain Dinners, but they all are caught by a trap and thrown in a Seastone cage by Crocodile.

Vivi is surrounded by Billions, but is saved by  Pell, a guard of the king who flew to Rainbase after Karoo's arrival in order to scout. Pell however is defeated by Miss All-Sunday and Vivi is taken to the Rain Dinners basement. There Crocodile tells her his plan to overthrow Arabasta while it is being executed.

In Alubarna,  Mr. 4 and  Miss Merry Christmas have kidnapped King Nefertari Cobra while Mr. 2 Bon Kurei acts as him in Nanohana alongside a fake group of soldiers. There, he "admits" that he used  Dance Powder to make it so that it rains only in Alubarna, and orders his soldiers to destroy the town, because they were the ones who saw the powder being carried in. Koza confronts him, but he is shot.  Mr. 1 and  Miss Doublefinger add to this destruction by crashing a huge ship filled with weapons into Nanohana.

However, during execution Mr. 2 is spotted changing back by a local kid named  Kappa, but the child is taken care of by Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger. Kappa, heavily wounded, is spotted by rebel soldiers, and seeing what the "king" has done, Koza decides to launch an attack on Alubarna.

Crocodile dares Vivi to try and help her friends and he floods the room, lets Bananawani in, and has one swallow the key. However, he suddenly gets a phone call by a Mr. Prince, recognized by the crew as Sanji, who starts off by imitating the phone call in Little Garden. Sanji makes Crocodile believe he got caught in front of the Rain Dinners and Crocodile goes to check out the situation in front of the casino. Chopper acts as a decoy, using his powers to avoid Crocodile while Sanji destroys the bridge between the Rain Dinners and the rest of Rainbase to ensure that Crocodile cannot return to Rain Dinners right away. With Smoker's suggestion, Sanji kicks the right Bananawani with the key, making it cough up both the key and a large wax ball.

As it turns out, the wax ball was created by Mr. 3 to protect himself from being digested, but still wanting revenge, Mr. 3 gets rid of the key (which is actually a fake). However, Sanji forces him to make a copy of the key using his powers, and releases everyone. When Crocodile returns, he sees that everyone is gone, as they had escaped by going underwater (with Sanji and Zoro carrying Luffy and Smoker through the water because of their Devil Fruit powers).

Chopper picks up the crew with a  Moving Crab named  Hasami, a friend of Matsuge. Smoker decides not to pursue the Straw Hats to repay the favor to them for saving his life and instead gives the order to have nearby Marine forces depart for Arabasta immediately, heading out to their ship and leaving Tashigi in charge. As the Straw Hats run away, Crocodile tries to snatch Vivi from the crab, but she is saved by Luffy who lets himself get dragged off by the crab, promising to meet them in Alubarna.

Crocodile says that he will humor Luffy for three minutes but will finish him off once that time is up. Luffy attacks Crocodile but discovers that he cannot hit Crocodile as he just turns into sand thanks to the ability of his devil fruit, the  Suna Suna no Mi. Crocodile also shows off some attacks as well, one of which dries Luffy's arm out, but Luffy takes water from his small barrel to restore his strength.

Once the three minutes are up, Crocodile creates a sandstorm and sends it off to Yuba, where Toto is, and explains that he was the one who was sending storms there every day. Luffy yells for him to stop it but Crocodile impales him with his hook during his distress. When Luffy proves he is still alive, Crocodile leaves him in quicksand to die.

Luckily, Luffy is saved by Miss All-Sunday after Crocodile's departure. She then leaves Luffy in the hands of Pell, telling Pell that Luffy is responsible for the safe return of Vivi.

#### Arriving in Alubarna: The War Begins![]

The rest of the Straw Hat crew is on the way to Alubarna, only to discover that the Sandora River is in their path and that moving crabs cannot swim. They try anyway, but they almost drown and are attacked by a Sandora Rare Catfish. However, the fish is defeated by the Kung-Fu Dugongs they met before. The Dugongs bring them on the back of the fish to the other side of the river where they are met by Karoo and the  Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops, the fastest animals on Arabasta.

Meanwhile the Rebel Army under the leadership of Koza have started their rush on Alubarna. Alubarna is evacuated and the royal army, led by  Chaka, is preparing the city for the rebel attack. Outside of Alubarna, the officer agents are waiting for Vivi to arrive and catch her but are thrown into confusion as six hooded people arrive on Super Spot-Billed Ducks. They are forced to pursue them in a hasty decision trying to figure out which one is Vivi.

The real Vivi however hid behind a rock and waited for the Straw Hats to distract the officer agents to buy her time. She tries to stop the rebel army, but a dust cloud caused by a Baroque Works agent under cover in the royal army prevents the Rebel Army from seeing her. She is covered by Karoo to not get trampled down by the rebel army. As she awakes, she is greeted by Usopp, but she sees through Mr. 2's disguise (he beat up Usopp and Matsuge shortly before) as he does not show her the special mark under his cloth. Karoo runs off with her climbing the steep walls of Alubarna but still is pursued by Mr. 2. However, he gets delayed by Sanji, who buys Vivi time to get to the palace.

The Straw Hats each face a dangerous battle. Chopper and Usopp battle Mr. 4, his devil fruit gun/dog  Lassoo, and Miss Merry Christmas, despite Usopp taking serious injures the duo manage to turn their enemies' attacks against them and defeat the trio. Sanji takes Mr. 2 Bon Kurei in a very comical yet brutal match of martial arts where Mr. 2 takes advantage of Sanji's weakness towards women by turning his head into Nami to take the upper hands until Sanji figures out his weakness and emerges the victor. Nami fights Miss Doublefinger in her first solo fight in the series, using a new weapon created by Usopp called the  Clima-Tact and her knowledge of weather to beat her opponent.

Zoro faces against Mr. 1 where Zoro has to confront and overcome his lingering problem of being unable to cut steel before striking down Mr. 1. Vivi arrives at the palace and gives order for the Royal Army to blow up the palace in order to get everyone's attention but is stopped by Crocodile. The army, realizing what is happening, try to enter the palace but are stopped by Miss All-Sunday. Koza also arrives at the scene, intending to demand Cobra's surrender, only to find out the truth of the situation. Crocodile reveals that he is going to blow up the palace plaza, soon to be center point of battle, with a massive and powerful bomb. He also reveals his true intentions: to find the location of the secret ancient weapon  Pluton, which is said to be buried in Arabasta.

#### An Explosive Climax: Rain Falls on Arabasta[]

Koza wants to warn the city but is stopped by Vivi, who states that it will create a panic. The Royal Army raises the white flag, with Koza in front, but he is shot down by a double agent in the Royal Army, provoking the rebels. A battle starts on the palace plaza and Vivi watches in horror. Crocodile proceeds to throw Vivi off a palace wall, but she is saved by Luffy who came in flying on Pell's back. Vivi meets the rest of the Straw Hats on the foot of the wall and goes to search for the bomb with them and Pell.

Luffy flings himself back up to Crocodile and Miss All Sunday goes off with Cobra to the  Poneglyph, which is supposed to reveal the location of Pluton. Luffy, armed with a barrel of water, confronts Crocodile again, as he found his weakness and manages to get a few good hits. Crocodile however can still dry him up and stop his attempts at getting him wet by trying to blow away the soaked Luffy and his barrel. Seeing this, Luffy decides to take in all the water from the barrel, completely filling him, dubbing himself "Water Luffy". Crocodile does not take this form seriously and pays for it when Luffy fires a water bubble completely soaking Crocodile, and hits him with a .

While the fight continues,  Miss All-Sunday takes the nails painfully out of Cobra's body and cuffs him with  her powers to force the King to the location of Pluton. Meanwhile, a furious Crocodile recovers and orders his partner to quickly depart. Soon, the  Warlord of the Sea reveals that his powers affect  including inanimate objects and proceeds to dry out the entire garden of the Royal Palace, and anything connected to it, forcing Luffy to attempt to hang on to the walls. Unfortunately, Crocodile appears grabbing Luffy by the neck. He attempts to soak the Baroque Works leader but misses and is dehydrated in response and left to die once again. Luckily, the water bubbles that Luffy fired fall back down on him re-hydrating him and narrowly saving his life. Thus, Luffy goes on to pursue Crocodile.

Miss All Sunday is confronted by Marines led by Tashigi. Having a more than personal enmity against Marines than other pirates, she yells at them to get out of her way. Tashigi demands she releases Cobra, but Miss All Sunday is not prepared to take orders from those who directly take orders from the  World Government. Tashigi is later informed by one of her men that Miss All Sunday was originally known as " Nico Robin", who received a bounty of 79,000,000 as a child because she was believed to have been responsible for the sinking of six warships.

Visibly angered, Miss All Sunday easily dispatches the Marine grunts, and defeats Tashigi with her Devil Fruit ability. As Tashigi struggles for her sword, Crocodile appears, calling her superior Smoker "cowardly" and mocking her and the Marines' ideals of " Justice" before departing again. Tashigi is left crying confused as to what action she should take, and angry she is not strong enough.

Vivi, Pell and the Straw Hat crew are separately fighting their way through gangs of Billions and Rebel/Royal Army fights to find the hideout for the bomb, but without any luck. Right then Vivi thinks about the only place that would be useful for launching such an attack: the clock tower, which used to be a hideout for Koza and her other friends.

Usopp calls all the crew mates to the clock tower, but they turn up on different levels (the top can only be reached through a secret staircase at the base), and Pell is shot down by  Miss Father's Day, who, alongside  Mr. 7, is preparing the cannon. The Straw Hats take advantage of being on different levels of the tower as Nami plans on flinging Vivi to the top level of the tower through multiple stations each assisted by a Straw Hats member. She reaches the cannon and defeats Mr. 7 and Miss Father's Day and stops the cannon from going off, only to discover that it is a time bomb that will go off regardless of being shot or not. Just when it seems everything for naught Pell shows up and carries the bomb off into the sky, allowing it to explode high and harmlessly above the city while sacrificing himself.

However, despite the bomb's explosion knocking the soldiers over, they simply get up and continue the battle. Desperately, Vivi repeatedly yells for them to stop fighting, but her voice is not heard.

Meanwhile, Miss All-Sunday and King Cobra go in the hidden Grave of the Kings and find the poneglyph. Crocodile soon arrives but does not get the information he wants from the stone. He turns his back on Nico Robin and attacks her while she tries an assassination attempt of her own but fails. Cobra triggers a destruction effect on the grave to keep the secrets safe, but Crocodile points out that he can easily escape with his ability. On his way out however, he is confronted by Luffy again. With Luffy soaked in blood, the punches he delivers to Crocodile negate his powers, due to blood also able to harden sand. Crocodile is now determined to end it once and for all, releasing the golden cover to reveal a poison hook.

Luffy fights him and gains the upper hand, but eventually gets struck by the hook and is poisoned. However, he is so determined to send Crocodile flying and help Vivi that it hardly phases him much to Crocodile's increasing frustration. Crocodile goes to end it with a hidden knife in his hook. But Luffy dodges it and kicks Crocodile into the air to which Crocodile counters with an attack that further decreases the stability of the catacombs. Luffy weathers it and manages to get himself into the air afterwards. Both pirates go for a final attack with Luffy managing to bust through Crocodiles', slamming him with a massive attack called Gomu Gomu no Storm.

Crocodile is smashed through the roof of the mausoleum, through solid bedrock, and into the air, knocking over several buildings in the process landing the Baroque Works president in the center of the capital. Cobra crawls to the victorious young pirate to thank him for defeating Crocodile, to which Luffy replies "no problem" and smiles. Luffy is later saved from Crocodile's poison by Nico Robin who gives him the antidote. Luffy manages to awaken enough to grab Robin and Cobra and carry them out before the grave caves in.

On the surface, Vivi continues her plead as the Rebels and Royal Guard continue to fight as the sky seemed to signify Crocodile's defeat and loss of influence of the land by raining for the first time in years. The Rebels and Royal Guards notice the rain and begin to cease fighting and Vivi's pleas are finally heard. With their attention on the princess who had be thought missing for two years, Vivi tells them that the rain has fallen as it will always fall, and the nightmare is over.

#### A Farewell and a New Crew Member[]

Nefertari Cobra delivers Luffy on his back to the Straw Hats and tells them what happened. Vivi meets up with the group introducing her father to the crew. While concerned for their welfare, the crew state the kingdom comes first and convince her to help Cobra address the subjects. She complies and heads off with him as the crew all pass out from their injuries around Luffy.  Igaram, Vivi's bodyguard who was thought dead since  Whisky Peak, shows up in Alubarna with Kappa, the beaten-up child from Nanohana, in his arms. He reveals the truth of Baroque Works' ploy to everyone. At last, Cobra himself informs both sides that whoever they rose their swords at and whoever they pointed their guns at no longer matters. Furthermore, while they cannot erase what happened from history, but they can together rebuild the country. Rebels and Royal Guards alike were moved by his wise words, and the war officially ended. The Straw Hats, meanwhile, are spared by Tashigi's marine forces, who instead arrest Crocodile and strip him of  Warlord of the Sea rank, and are later led to the palace.

Luffy awakens after three days of sleep, demanding food immediately. Luffy and his crew are hailed as heroes in the palace for their efforts in saving the country, but it is kept secret on the outside. Bon Kurei suddenly calls the crew, telling the Straw Hats that he has saved their ship from the Marines and is protecting it for them. The Straw Hat crew gives Vivi a choice of coming with them if she wants to, and to make her decision by noon.

The Straw Hats and Bon Kurei's crew leave in the morning, but they get engaged in a battle with Marine Captain  Hina the Black Cage. Bon Kurei and his crew disguise themselves as the Straw Hats to draw their attention, giving them the opportunity to flee though Luffy yells he will never forget them. In the end, Vivi chose not to come with them, but came to wave them goodbye, holding her speech over a  Den Den Mushi. The Straw Hats respond back by showing her their friendship marks on their arms before sailing off.

However, no sooner than the Straw Hat leave Arabasta, Nico Robin a.k.a. Miss All-Sunday makes herself known having hid herself on board of the Going Merry before their departure from Arabasta. She claims she wants to join the crew for Luffy saved her, even though she lost her will to live, making her their problem. Luffy accepts her offer to join the crew, but the rest (excluding Sanji) are suspicious of her. However, she manages to quickly win everyone's favor, though Zoro remains wary of her. With an unexpected seventh member of the crew, the Straw Hats continue onward with their voyage of the Grand Line for their next adventure.

## Sky Island Saga

### __Jaya Arc__

#### An Archaeologist and a Ship from the Sky[]

With Princess  Vivi safely back in  Arabasta and a new crewmate,  Nico Robin, on board, the  Straw Hats' next adventure begins when  a giant ship suddenly falls from the sky. At this point, the  Log Pose starts to point straight up and Robin explains that the log is "captured" by an island with a stronger magnetic fieldâa  Sky Island. While exploring the sinking ruins of the ship, they come across an old map of a land named  Skypiea. Through a skull and some books, they figure out that the ship is the Saint Briss, which left the Kingdom of Breeze in South Blue 208 years ago. This piques the interest of the crew and they decide to salvage the sunken ship.

When they try to salvage the sunken ship for more information, they come across a group of pirates led by  Masira, who claims that he has control over the territory and all ships that sank there belong to him. Masira and his crew begin the salvage operation and are in the process of raising the ship when they run into a snag.  Luffy,  Zoro, and  Sanji, who were underwater searching the wreck, start beating up Masira's crew. Masira goes down to handle things and confront them when a Giant Sea Turtle comes along and swallows the ship, though Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Masira all escape. However, out of nowhere, the sky turns dark and three humongous shadows appear. Out of fear, the pirates run away as quickly as possible. Luckily, Robin manages to take an eternal pose to the nearby island of  Jaya from  Masira's ship, and goes there to find more information.

#### The Dreamless City: Mock Town[]

Roshio the Executioner, a pirate with a 48 million bounty, wins a poker game against Hyena  Bellamy, a pirate with a bounty of 55 million. Bellamy accuses Roshio of cheating and gets  Sarquiss to back him up. When Roshio disagrees, Bellamy stabs his hand with a knife and shoots him in the head.

In the port town of  Mock Town, the group of Luffy, Zoro, and  Nami encounter several odd people, all of whom are members of the  Blackbeard Pirates, until they end up at a hotel. There, they encounter  Sarquiss of the  Bellamy Pirates, who insults the group and even gives them some money to buy better clothes. They later end up in a bar, where they encounter  Blackbeard himself, though they do not know who he is. After he leaves, Bellamy himself barges in looking for Luffy, claiming that he wants to test him to see if he is worthy of joining his " New Age" of pirates. However, when Nami asks the bartender for information about  Sky Island, Bellamy rejects this notion immediately and the entire bar starts ridiculing the three.

In Bellamy's "New Age", dreams will be worthless. He explains that so many people are focused on searching for dream treasures like the  City of Gold and the  One Piece, that they ignore all of the real treasures around them. Bellamy attacks Luffy and Zoro while the other people in the bar start throwing things at them, but despite Nami's urging, they refuse to fight back, paralleling how Shanks and his crew did not fight back against  Higuma when he and his crew attacked them in  Makino's bar.

#### The Tale of Noland the Liar[]

They are laughed out of the bar, where they once again encounter Blackbeard, who states that they did the right thing not fighting back those who are not worth the effort of fighting against and encourages Luffy on his dreams. The three go back to the ship to discover that Robin has managed to find some relevant informationâon the other side of the island there is a man who might know how to reach Sky Island,  Mont Blanc Cricket. On the way there, they encounter  Shoujou, an orangutan pirate who has a 36 million bounty, and is also Masira's brother, but they manage to escape. They arrive at his house to find that it is empty, but they found a bookâthe story of  Mont Blanc Noland, a.k.a. "Liar Noland". Sanji explains that it is a fairy tale from  North Blue.

The story of Noland goes that while exploring the Grand Line hundreds of years ago, Noland came across a City of Gold. He returned to his home and informed the king, who accompanied him on the next journey to the island. However, when they reached the island, the City of Gold was gone. Angered, the king sentenced him to death for lying.

To his last breath, Noland claimed that he was telling the truth, and proclaimed that the City of Gold must have sunk underwater. However, no one would believe him, and he was executed. As it turned out, Cricket is a descendant of Noland and was trying to prove whether it exists or not by diving into the ocean every day to search for evidence, to the point of injuring himself.

Chopper treated him and they met up with Masira and Shoujou again, who helped Cricket out on his quest under the name " Saruyama Alliance". Cricket explained that if the Sky Island existed, the only way to reach it would be through " Knock Up Stream", a humongous geyser in the ocean. In order to reach it, Cricket has the Straw Hats go into the forest to search for a " South Bird", a bird whose head always points south. During this time, the Saruyama Alliance upgraded the  Going Merry in order to withstand Knock Up Stream.

#### The Captain's True Power: Luffy Vs. Bellamy[]

Meanwhile, hearing that Cricket managed to uncover some gold, Bellamy and his crew decided to steal it from him, severely injuring him and the others in the process using his " Bane Bane no Mi", which can turn his limbs into springs. When the crew returned with the South Bird in tow, Luffy decided to get the gold back. In Mock Town, new bounties were mailed in, and to everyone's surprise, they found out that Luffy's bounty was 100,000,000 while Zoroâs was 60,000,000âin comparison, Bellamy's was only 55,000,000. Bellamy scoffed at this, claiming that they were fakes that were made to scare him.

This calmed everyone down, until Luffy screamed for Bellamy to come out. Luffy demanded that Bellamy give the gold back, but he refused. Bellamy attacked him with his devil fruit powers, but Luffy still does not fight back. Angered, he decides to finish him off with his ultimate attack,  while still mocking him for following dreams. At this point, Luffy finally becomes fed up with Bellamy's words and took him down with a single punch. The terrified pirates realized that Luffy's wanted posters were actually real and ran away in fear.

Luffy then took the gold and went back to Cricket's house while the remainder of the Bellamy Pirates were too afraid to fight back. Upon hearing about his bounty, Blackbeard and his crew decided to strike.

#### A World on the Move and the Flying Ship[]

Somewhere else, on an island in the  Grand Line, the status of  Buggy and  his crew was shown, as  Ace boarded his ship and offered to help him search for Luffy. Meanwhile,  Shanks tried to contact  Whitebeard only to have his letter torn up, with Whitebeard telling the messenger,  Rockstar, to have Shanks meet him in person. Rockstar reported back, to which Shanks told the crew to prepare for a meeting with Whitebeard.

At  Mary Geoise, a meeting of the Marines and the  Seven Warlords of the Sea was being held to discuss what should be done about replacing the Warlord  Crocodile. Much to then-Fleet Admiral  Sengoku's surprise, two of the Seven Warlords ( Bartholomew Kuma and  Donquixote Doflamingo) were in attendance when  Hawkeye Mihawk arrived. Just when the actual meeting was about to begin,  Laffitte of the Blackbeard Pirates appeared to recommend his captain as Crocodile's replacement. The people there stated that nobody has ever heard about him, but Laffitte stated that they were presently working on a plan to change that.

When Luffy returned and gave Cricket his gold back, he and the crew set off for Knock Up Stream, led by the Saruyama Alliance and the South Bird. When they reach the right area, they were confronted by the Blackbeard Pirates, who revealed the Straw Hat Pirates' new bounties to them. However, before a battle ensued, the Straw Hats were caught in Knock Up Stream and were sent flying into the  White Sea, leaving the Blackbeard Pirates' raft to be destroyed and to fall to the sea below.

### __Skypiea Arc__

#### Ascending the Heavens: Arriving at the White Sea[]

Having ridden the  Knock Up Stream, the  Straw Hats find themselves in a sea of clouds (which, as they find out, has the same effect as normal water on a  Devil Fruit user), but before they have a chance to relax, they are quickly attacked by a strange man in a mask who is riding on the clouds. The crew are unable to defend themselves, but they are thankfully saved by an old knight named  Gan Fall, who rides on a bird with  Devil Fruit powers named  Pierre. He points out to them that the reason that they could not fight back against the "Guerrilla" was due to the thin air, though immediately afterwards the crew says that they are starting to get used to it. Gan Fall gives them a whistle to summon him in case they run into more trouble, and the crew continues on.

They reach "Heaven's Gate", the entrance to  Skypiea where they are told to pay 1 billion  Extols per person as the entrance fee, but the crew have no idea what extol is. In response, the gatekeeper,  Amazon, basically tells them she does not care what they do but does not warn them that if they pass without paying, they will be marked as criminals, and the crew goes into Skypiea.

The ship reaches the shore of  Angel Island, the main part of Skypiea, where they meet a girl named  Conis and her father,  Pagaya. They let the crew come into their house so they can introduce them to Skypiean society, but  Nami decides to stay at the ocean and try out Pagaya's  Waver, a device similar to a jet-ski that can move under its own power without any  wind. While Conis explains the use of  Dials, Nami ends up riding the waver to a nearby island with a huge forest. When  Sanji points out that Nami is gone, Conis and Pagaya explain that the nearby island is known as  Upper Yard. Upper Yard is a forbidden sacred ground where  God  Enel and his  priests reside, and no one must ever set foot on it. This immediately sparks  Luffy's interest, and he commands that they head out to "rescue Nami", but he makes it obvious that he simply wants to go to Upper Yard to explore and have an adventure.

At Upper Yard, Nami witnesses Enel's priests chasing a  man who was searching for treasure on the island. However, before the priests can finish him off, Enel decides to act on his own and in a show of power, a massive beam of energy fires from the sky and disintegrates the treasure hunter.  Gedatsu of the priests explains to the others that their time limit was upâanother group of criminals has just appeared, a group of seven. From this, Nami realizes that they are talking about them, and rushes back to Angel Island.

Meanwhile, on Angel Island's beach, the crew encounters the  White Berets, led by Chief  McKinley, who act as Skypiea's lowest level of law enforcement. The White Berets explain that the Straw Hat Pirates are criminals, and that the punishment for illegally entering is to pay 10 times the entrance fee, or 10,000,000,000 Extols per person. Here, it is explained that there are 10 thousand extols per Belly, making the fee 1,000,000. The crew decides to wait for Nami to come back, but even doing minor things like snoring ends up raising the crime level. Nami eventually returns, but when she finds out about the fee, she rams the waver into McKinley while yelling that it is too high. In response, the White Berets launch an attack, only to be easily defeated by Luffy. This ends up raising them to Class 2 criminals that are to be dealt with by the priests.

The crew starts packing up to leave with Nami,  Chopper,  Robin, and  Zoro at the  ship while Luffy, Sanji, and Usopp get food and supplies from Pagaya's home. Suddenly, the ship is grabbed by a "Super-Express Speed Shrimp" that carries them to Upper Yard. Luffy, Sanji, and  Usopp, led by Conis, go to  Lovely Street in order to get a boat to rescue them. Conis lends them her dial-powered ship, the  Karasumaru, but before they leave, Luffy notes that she was shaking the entire time she was leading them. Conis reveals that she was the one who called the shrimp to take the ship and is intentionally leading them to Upper Yardâit is God Enel's will that they lead criminals to that island, and not following it will result in death. Upon hearing Conis say this, all of the townspeople run away. True to her word, Enel strikes and fires a massive beam of energy at her from the sky, but she is saved by the knight, Gan Fall. He explains that since both she and her father will be considered criminals, he will take them back to his house, which is out of Enel's range.

Despite this show of Enel's power, the three  pirates continue on to Upper Yard unhindered.

#### God's Judgment: The Four Ordeals of Upper Yard[]

Meanwhile, Nami, Zoro, Robin, and Chopper find themselves, and the ship, on top of a large  Sacrificial Altar surrounded by shark-infested clouds. Zoro, Robin and Nami decide to explore the Upper Yard for different reasons. Using a vine, the crew swings over to land, except Chopper who stays to guard the ship.

Luffy's group enters Upper Yard, and they travel through the " Milky Road", a cloud river, avoiding several dangerous traps. Eventually, they reach a hand stature with the river branching off into four paths going through each finger, each labeled with a different ordeal: " Ordeal of Swamp", " Ordeal of Iron", " Ordeal of String", and " Ordeal of Balls". Luffy chooses the Ordeal of Balls, thinking that it sounds fun, and after a drop, they find themselves in an area of the forest with several cloud balls floating around. Each of the " Surprise Balls" contains a different objectâsome contain snakes, other explosives, other harmless flowers, etc. At this point, the priest  Satori appears and attacks them, but they find that he is somehow able to read their minds using an ability called " Mantra". After a long and difficult battle, they manage to get past his mantra by turning his own attacks against him. Sanji debuts a new move called  which is enough to knock Satori out.

At Gan Fall's house, he explains to Conis and Pagaya how there is a constant war between the guerrillas, known as  Shandia, and the  Skypieans over control of Upper Yard, and as the previous "God" (more accurate, the ruler of Skypiea) he tried to find peace. However, once Enel took over, all notions of peace were abandoned.

Meanwhile, the priest  Shura arrives at the Sacrificial Altar to find that Chopper is the only one left to kill. In response, Chopper uses the whistle to call Gan Fall. Shura heavily damages the ship with his fire-based attacks, but before he can finish off Chopper, Gan Fall attacks. They seem to be evenly matched, until Shura starts his "Ordeal of String", which activates several dials that shoot out nearly invisible string to tangle up the foe. Gan Fall, Pierre, and Chopper end up falling into the clouds.

After looking around a bit, Zoro's group reaches a startling conclusionâUpper Yard is part of  Jaya. Specifically, it is the location of the gold city mentioned in  Liar Noland's tale. In other words, the gold city did not sink into the water, it was launched into the sky by the Knock Up Stream. At the same time, Chopper wakes up to find that he, along with Gan Fall and Pierre, are safe on the Sacrificial Altar. As it turns out, they were saved by a flock of giant  South Birds.

At the tribe of the Shandia, a girl named  Aisa, who also has the ability to use mantra, reveals that both Satori and Gan Fall were defeated. Taking this as an opportunity,  Wyper, leader of the Shandia warriors and the one who attacked the Straw Hats earlier, decides to invade Upper Yard. He and the tribe's warriors battle with the remaining Priests. When Wyper comes across Luffy's group, he warns them to leave the island and not to interfere. The battle between the Shandia and the Priests seems to be even, until one of their strongest warriors,  Kamakiri, is defeated while trying to rescue Aisa's cousin,  Raki. Once Wyper hears about this, he orders a retreat.

Nami, Zoro, and Robin return to the Altar, and at the same time Luffy's group finally arrives. It's getting dark, so the crew decides to camp out in the forestâif they were found, they would have more room to fight and they would not destroy the Going Merry more. The Straw Hats pool all of their information together, and surmise that the Upper Yard is actually the lost City of Gold. With this information, they decide to steal from the gold city before they go back to the  Blue Sea. In order to come up with a plan, Nami puts the maps of Jaya and Skypiea together to form the image of a skull. Noland's logbook stated that the  city of gold was in the skull's right eye, which they realize is referring to Jaya's geography. To celebrate, Luffy starts a huge bonfire, much to Nami's annoyance, since it will just get the priests' attention. Along with a pack of wolves, the Straw Hats dance around the fire as an "Eve of Gold Festival". At this point, Gan Fall regains consciousness. He explains to Robin that objects from the Blue Sea sent to the  White Sea by Knock Up Stream are considered very valuable treasure. The most valuable was the dirt and soil called  Vearth, which can rear plant life much better than cloud can, causing a religious reverence for it by the Skypieans. When Upper Yard was launched into the sky hundreds of years ago, it was considered a holy land, which led to a war with the native Shandia over control of the land.

After the party ends, Usopp goes to the river to urinate when he sees a  strange figure fixing the Going Merry, but fog prevents him from seeing it clearly. In the morning, they find that all of the damage caused by Shura has been fixed and the upgrades done by the  Saruyama Alliance have been removed. Not only is it odd that someone else would help them in the enemy's territory, but also that the person would know what the ship originally looked like. However, they decide not to focus too much on it, and once they get the ship off of the altar, Nami forms a plan. While Luffy, Zoro, Chopper, and Robin go to the city, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji will take the Going Merry and Gan Fall out of Upper Yard.

Meanwhile, Wyper punishes Raki because a bag of dirt, given to her by Aisa, was what got her caught in the first place. Kamakiri stops him, stating that he can still fight. Thus, Wyper decides to start one final offensive, telling his soldiers that they are retaking their home. At Upper Yard, Enel reveals himself and meets with the priests, telling them that they will be free to use their ordeals on all of the island. As the Shandia and the Straw Hats both head into the island, the Survival Game begins.

#### War for Upper Yard: Enel's Survival Game[]

Luffy's group set off for the gold city, only to encounter a  gigantic python. Due to its attack, the group gets separated, with only Robin still on the right path. On the Going Merry, Gan Fall recounts the history of his country, the origins of the Shandians and the rift between their people. He tells them that six years ago, Enel appeared out of nowhere leading a powerful army and gained control over Upper Yard. Gan Fall then explains how dials can be used as weapons, demonstrating with his  Impact Dial, which can absorb and reflect impact attacks.

Meanwhile, the Shandia come across Shura and are immediately caught in his Ordeal of String. However, Wyper managed to avoid it and defeats Shura using a  Reject Dial, a thought-to-be-extinct version of the Impact Dial that multiplies the attack power, but also damages the user. As the warriors split up and continue on, Enel releases his 50  Divine Soldiers, led by  Yama, to fight them. At this point, Enel predicts that within a few hours there will only be five participants in the Survival Game, including himself, left.

Zoro ends up facing one of the Shandia warriors,  Braham, but defeats him using his . At the same time, Luffy encounters Wyper once again. Though they seem to be evenly matched, Luffy is eaten by the giant python, interrupting the battle. Chopper ends up encountering Priest Gedatsu, who, after being defeated by the reindeer, gets caught in his own Ordeal of Swamp and falls to the  Blue Sea. Robin encounters Yama at some ancient ruins and defeats him. On the Going Merry, Enel appears to tell Gan Fall that he has no use for the island anymore and is about to leave. When Sanji and Usopp attack him, he uses his  Devil Fruit ability to electrocute them, rendering them both unconscious. Immediately afterwards, Satori's brothers  Hotori and Kotori arrive to get revenge, but are defeated by Nami and Gan Fall. During all of these events, the minor Shandia warriors and the Divine Soldiers battle fiercely.

Meanwhile, Aisa, the Shandia girl who can use Mantra, uses a dial boat to go to Upper Yard, but the ship shuts down and she is picked up by Conis and Pagaya. After Hotori and Kotori's defeat, Gan Fall leaves the ship with Pierre in order to find out what Enel meant, leaving Nami his Impact Dial. Immediately afterwards, Conis and Pagaya use a  Milky Dial to form a shortcut to the exit and meet with Nami on the ship, giving Nami a new waver. While they take care of Usopp and Sanji, Zoro unintentionally ends up with a South Bird following him everywhere, because it thinks Zoro has food. In the snake's stomach, Luffy sees tons of gold and ruins, but cannot seem to find his way out, under the assumption that he's in a cave.

A bored Enel decides to participate in his "game" and attacks the Shandia warrior Kamakiri. However, his electric attack unintentionally knocks out all of warriors fighting along the river. It's two hours into the Survival Game and there are only 25 participants left. Enel comments that it's more than he expected, so he decides to even it up a bit to make his prediction come true.

During all of this, Robin reaches the city of gold, which has been separated onto different layers of clouds, to find that there is no gold, but she instead finds out that a  Poneglyph is in the cityâspecifically, on the  golden bell. However, the bell is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Chopper climbs a  giant beanstalk he finds in search for the gold city, only to end up in the domain of Priest Ohm, who badly wounds him. On the Going Merry, Aisa tries to escape, but when Nami chases after her, the python appears and attacks them, because Luffy is hitting the lining of his stomach out of frustration. Using the waver to escape, Nami and Aisa end up even deeper in the jungle. At the same time, the South Bird, while trying to steal Zoro's backpack, carries Zoro through the air but drops him when the snake tries to eat him.

Wyper reaches  Ohm's area when Gan Fall appears to explain that he has just been to  God's Shrine and it's completely destroyed with Enel nowhere in sight, meaning there is no point in going there. Zoro ends up landing here, and Ohm declares that not one of them will escape his Ordeal of Iron. As they all fight, Nami and Aisa, along with a couple of soldiers, end up in the area too. Wyper attacks them, telling Aisa to get out of the way, but Gan Fall and Pierre save them, only to end up being eaten by the python.

As Zoro fights, eventually defeating, Ohm, the group in the python ends up meeting with Luffy. In the ruins of the gold city Shandora, Robin encounters Enel, who explains that he took the gold from all the buildings, but expresses interest when Robin mentions the gold bell. On the edge of the island where the Going Merry is, one of his soldiers warns them that Enel is planning on destroying the sky islands, and Enel attacks him, along with Pagaya, with his lightning attack, leaving Conis to go warn everyone on Angel Island. Enel then destroys the clouds above him and Robin, sending Zoro, Wyper, and the snake falling to where he is. Gan Fall and Nami manage to escape the snake, accidentally leaving behind Luffy, Aisa, and Pierre, and after Enel electrocutes the python, he announces that with three minutes until time is up, there are six survivors left. One of them will have to go. When he asks the remaining survivors who it should be, they unanimously decide Enel.

At this point, Enel explains why he wants to destroy Skypieaâpeople living in the sky is unnatural, so as God it is his job to keep the natural order. After that, he wants to take people with him to the " Fairy Vearth", a piece of Vearth of infinite size, where it is only natural for God to reside as opposed to the limited Upper Yard. In response, Gan Fall attacks him, only to be defeated, thus making God's prediction true, the 5 survivors being Enel, Wyper, Zoro, Robin and Nami. When Robin says that he cannot simply destroy the land haphazardly, since he wants the gold bell, Enel replies that he already knows where it is and attacks her, since he hates manipulative women.

Zoro fights back, but then Wyper uses  Seastone to shut off Enel's Devil Fruit and uses his Reject Dial to kill him. However, with the Seastone off of him, Enel uses his ability to restart his heart and comes back to life. Enel defeats all of the fighters, leaving only Nami. With no hope to escape, Nami says that she will go with him, and she follows him, taking along her waver so she can escape at the right time. However, this proves to be useless, as Enel reveals his means of escapeâthe  Ark Maxim, a flying ship using his powers as a source of energy, using the gold from the city as a conductor.

#### Rubber Vs Lightning: Skypiea's Destruction[]

Meanwhile, Luffy's group manages to escape from the python and come across Enel's victims. After a barely conscious Robin explains the situation, Aisa explains that she can use her  Mantra to lead Luffy to him. At  Angel Beach, Conis tries to convince everyone to leave to island, but she is labeled a heretic. To prove her point, she loudly yells that she does not consider Enel as God, and everyone runs away to escape God's Judgement. However, when nothing happens to her, they realize that she is rightâafter all, Enel will be destroying the entire land soon, so there's no point in specifically killing one person. They panic and run away, but the White Berets managed to bring order to the evacuation, so Conis hurries back to Upper Yard to show the Straw Hats the way out of Skypiea.

Luffy finally reaches Enel, whom Enel fights. He is completely stunned, however, to find that his lightning attacks have no effect on Luffy, because he's a rubber man. Not only that, but Luffy can bypass his Logia ability and physically hurt him. After calming down, Enel switches to a different mode of attack by heating up staff, teleporting around, and using his mantra to predict Luffy's moves. During the fight, Enel had used the Ark Maxim to start a process he called  to form massive thunderclouds. By doing this, he can amplify his power enough to destroy the islands. They continue to fight and Luffy manages to get the upper hand until Enel attaches a large ball of gold to the rubber man's arm and knocks him off the ship back onto Upper Yard.

As Nami prepares to fight against Enel, using her  Clima-Tact's thunder balls to deflect his weaker attacks, Sanji and Usopp finally wake up. When Sanji declares that he is going to rescue Nami, he forces Usopp to grapple them onto the ship. On the deck, Usopp distracts Enel while Nami prepares the waver to jump off, aiming for the patch of island cloud around the beanstalk, getting a hit in the process. But as Enel prepares to kill them both, Sanji gets in the way of the attack, allowing them to escape. Immediately afterwards, the ship starts to blow up, revealing that Sanji was wrecking the machines allowing Ark Maxim to fly. As Enel leaves to fix the problem, Usopp, who had actually used one of his devices to stick onto the side of the ship, climbs back up and jumps off with Sanji. Enel manages to keep the ship flying with emergency dials and begins to shower the land with thunderbolts.

Back in the ruins of Shandora, Luffy manages to recover and, along with Aisa and Pierre, runs towards the beanstalk. After leaving the other two with Robin, who had carried everyone back up to the surface, Luffy runs up the beanstalk with the gold ball still attached to his arm. At this point, Wyper, Zoro, and Gan Fall wake up, and Nami tells everyone to go to the Going Merry and uses her waver to try to reach Luffy and get him to leave too. As Wyper reflects on a story told to him as a child, which shows what really happened when  Mont Blanc Noland came to Jaya, Luffy continues up the beanstalk and is eventually met by Nami. Nami tries to convince him to leave, but he replies that he has to ring the bell so  Mont Blanc Cricket and everyone else will know that the city of gold is in the sky.

As Enel reaches the top, he unleashes his ultimate technique: . Using this, he destroys all of Angel Island, forming a gigantic hole in the clouds. When he reaches the Golden Bell, he creates another  much larger than the first, meant to destroy all of Skypiea. Nami realizes that everyone is still near the beanstalk, so she sends down instructions to cut down the plant so that it will fall towards Enel. Despite Zoro's efforts, it remains standing, so, upon hearing why Luffy wants to ring the bell, Wyper uses his Reject Dial to fell the beanstalk. Using the waver's full power, Nami and Luffy blast up the falling plant and are sent flying towards Enel. However, Luffy pushes Nami onto a cloud and makes a detour into the .

As all of the Skypieans and Shandia pray for the real God to act, Luffy swings the gold ball around to draw the electricity from the  into him and eventually breaks it apart. Despite Enel unleashing his full power, Luffy sends him crashing into the bell, sending a ring that could be heard everywhere. On the island of Jaya below, Cricket and the Saruyama Alliance hear the sound. At this point, Cricket explains the "monsters" at the beginning of the Jaya arcâit was theorized that these giants were actually shadows cast by people in the sky, and this is proven true by a giant shadow of Luffy in a victorious pose. Cricket breaks down crying, both because the city really existed and because he was glad that Luffy was alright. They then try to think of another dream to pursue. However, for the people of Skypiea, the ring means something else: the war between the Skypieans and Shandia is over.

#### History and Gold: Farewell to the White Sea[]

As Enel and his ark, along with the bell, fall into the sea clouds below and the sky clears, everyone gathers on Upper Yard. The Shandia warriors begin to recover, Pagaya is revealed to be alive, and the ones who were forced to build the Ark Maxim were reunited with their families. At night, Wyper regains consciousness to find that he is being taken care of by Conis, Gan Fall, and his tribe's chief. Wyper tries to convince his chief that they have to fight the Sky People to take control of Upper Yard, but he explains that war is the farthest thing from everyone's mind. Wyper runs outside to see everyone celebrating.

Meanwhile, Enel has recovered and is back on his ark. However, he decides to let them keep their land as he heads towards the Fairy Vearth by himself, which, as it turns out, is actually the moon.

The next day, they find out that the bell was caught in the fallen Giant Jack, so the Shandia and the Sky People work together to pull it up, representing their unity. On the base of the belfry is a Poneglyph, which Robin deciphers to be information on the location of the ancient weapon  Poseidon. With this, the Shandia find out that they have no need to protect it anymore, so they no longer have to fight. To Robin's surprise, however, there is another message on the gold itself, from  Gol D. Roger. From reading it, she realizes that the  Rio Poneglyph is on  Laugh Tale. In order to thank the Straw Hats, they offer one of the belfry's pillars, which Robin accepts.

Meanwhile, Usopp managed to exchange several rubber bands, claiming that they were the same material that defeated Enel, for dials from the Skypieans. Inside the still-sleeping snake, the rest of the pirates steal several bags full of gold. When Robin appears with all of the people carrying the pillar, the Straw Hats think that they are attacking them for stealing the gold and that the pillar is a giant cannon, so they run away. Robin tells the Skypieans that it looks like they do not want it and she runs after them. The entire crew boards the Going Merry and, led by Conis and Pagaya, they reach "Cloud End" where they can return to the  Blue Sea. As Gan Fall is once again made "God" of Skypiea, the Straw Hat Pirates fall to the Blue Sea, aided by an octopus balloon to slow their descent.

## Water 7 Saga

### __Long Ring Long Land Arc__

#### Return to the Blue Sea: The Davy Back Fight Challenge[]

In  Mock Town, a west coast town in  Jaya,  Bellamy and  Sarquiss are forced to fight each other as they are being controlled by  Donquixote Doflamingo using his  Devil Fruit powers. He is punishing them for their defeat against the Straw Hat Pirates, thereby disgracing his  Jolly Roger and in turn, his name. He tells them that he has no room for small-time hoods like them under his command and dismisses them from his crew. Doflamingo then excitedly declares that the New Age has arrived where only the strong and the real pirates will survive.

Luffy and his crew arrive at the island of Long Ring Long Land, a bizarre island where everything, including the animals and plants, stretches in either length or height. Despite  Nami's warning  Chopper,  Usopp and Luffy go exploring and find an unoccupied house, a tall horse and two "walking" stalks of bamboo. They break the bamboo and  Tonjit plummets down. Tonjit has lived on the bamboo stilts for 10 years. He is delighted that his horse,  Shelly, waited for him for so long although his folk are nomads and left the place years ago. He also tells the Straw Hats the geography of Long Ring Long Land, which consist of ten islands that are connected and can be walked between on foot during a big ebb every year. Tonjit's tribe changes the island every three years. After that he takes Shelly for a ride.

In the meantime, the  Going Merry and the rest of the crew are surrounded by an unnamed pirate crew, stating that their Captain wants to play the Davy Back Fight with Luffy. Back at Tonjit's house, Chopper, Usopp and Luffy watch Tonjit riding Shelly just to see her getting shot by  Foxy the Silver Fox, who asks Luffy to play the Davy Back Fight. In the Davy Back Fight, members of each pirate crew face off in different events in which the winner of the event can steal crew members of the losing team, even the captain. The Jolly Roger can also be taken and with it the dignity of the crew.

Foxy tricks Luffy who is angry for the unprovoked attack at Shelly and unknowingly accepts. Foxy explains the rules of the Davy Back Fight as follows:

#### The Underhanded Silver Fox: The Donut Race and Groggy Ring[]

In this event, three members of each crew must build a makeshift boat out of nothing but three barrels and two oars. Each team then races around the island, trying to avoid obstacles and enemy cheating in order to make it to the finish line first. Each team is given an  Eternal Pose so that they can find their way back to the island if they get too far away from the shore.

A team of Nami, Usopp, and  Robin face a team of  Porche,  Capote, and  Monda in the manga. In the anime, all of the Straw Hats and most of Foxy's crew participates. Though the Straw Hats manage to get in the lead, Foxy cheats and uses his Devil Fruit to slow them down enough for his team to pass them. Foxy takes Chopper to be part of his crew and while Chopper starts crying over how he does not want this and how he only went out in the sea with Luffy to be a Straw Hat, he starts saying he does not want this and refuses to be a part of Foxy's crew and starts crying more, prompting  Zoro to slam his drink to the ground and yells at Chopper to shut up, stating it is shameful what he is doing. He tells Chopper he was the one who chose to go out to sea and not Luffy. They accepted the game and lost, and Zoro tells Chopper he should not be crying and as a man he should sit back, shut up and watch the rest of the games as they win him back. Nami scolds Zoro over his mean treatment of Chopper, however, Chopper realizes Zoro is right and mans up, surprising Nami as Zoro declares they will win him back.

In this event, the teams of three from each pirate crew choose one of their members to be the 'Ball', and the other team has to try and knock the opposing team's ball into the goal once. This event forbids the use of weapons, as it is a sport, though other kinds of cheating are allowed.

Zoro and  Sanji take on a team of 3 known as the  Groggy Monsters. Chopper was to participate, but Foxy won him in the previous game. However, the Groggy Monsters use weapons and the referee pretends he does not see them. After much difficulty, mostly due to fighting between the two crewmates, and partly due to a bias on the referee's part against them, Sanji and Zoro team up and defeat the Groggy Monsters. The referee blows his whistle signifying Sanji and Zoro's victory. Luffy then takes Chopper back as their crew.

#### Putting the Crew on the Line: Captain Luffy Vs Captain Foxy[]

This event is a duel between the two captains. A cannon is spun to randomly determine the fighting area, and the goal is to knock the opposing captain out of the fighting area.

When Luffy and Foxy fight in this competition, the battle takes place on Foxy's ship, which is full of traps and weapons to give him the advantage. Before the match, Usopp persuades Luffy that wearing a large afro wig will increase his strength. Despite his foe using several of the ship's weapons and even robotic battle suits, Luffy manages to defeat Foxy by reflecting his beams back at him using a mirror and punching him into the ocean. In the manga, Foxy's flag is taken.

In the anime, Nami made a deal with Foxy that the winner would take 5 crewmembers, but Foxy changes this to 500 crewmembers, expecting the Straw Hats to "pay" for this through their children since they do not have that many. Thus, when Luffy wins, he takes Chopper, Robin, 497 members of Foxy's crew and their flag, leaving only 3 people. He later dismisses the crewmembers he won and they all run back to Foxy.

#### A Cold Wake-up Call: Admiral Aokiji Attacks[]

After Luffy has beaten Foxy and taken their flag (replacing it with one of his "drawings"), it is revealed that he only fought for Tonjit and Shelly. Back at the house they run into a very tall and thin man who is sleeping while standing in front of the house. After removing his sleeping mask, Robin is shocked as the man turns out to be  Aokiji, one of the three  admirals of the  Marines.

Aokiji states that he is privately on the island, does not seek a confrontation and only wanted to see where Robin ended up after leaving  Arabasta. After that he helps out Tonjit to get to his tribe by freezing the path to the next island with the power of the  Hie Hie no Mi. After Tonjit leaves, Aokiji confronts the crew as he sees them a threat for the world. The biggest threat he sees is Robin for her  ability to read the  Poneglyph and tells the crew that every organization Robin belonged to does not exist anymore and she is the only survivor each time.

Robin attacks Aokiji, but fails and Aokiji tries to retaliate with a strike from a sword he instantly made by freezing grass. Zoro blocks the strike and Sanji kicks the sword away, but both get caught by Aokiji, freezing Sanji's leg and Zoro's arm. Luffy tries a punch, but only gets his fist frozen on Aokiji's body. Aokiji freezes down Robin while Robin states she really did try to change and how she may have found her home and as she is frozen, Aokiji tries to shatter her with a punch, but Luffy saves her. When Aokiji tries to stomp her, Usopp grabs her from Luffy's arms and runs to the ship along with Nami and Chopper to unfreeze her. Luffy sends Zoro and Sanji after them declaring he'll fight Aokiji one-on-one. Chopper and Nami tend to the frozen Robin in order to unfreeze her, and Zoro and Sanji use the ocean to heal their frozen limbs. Usopp says that they should go back for Luffy despite Zoro saying otherwise, which prompts Usopp to yell that they need to go back. He thinks that Sanji and Zoro do not care for Luffy's safety, which enrages Sanji and tells Usopp that Luffy demanded to be alone in the duel and they need to believe in him.

Luffy battles Aokiji but only ends up being entirely frozen. Aokiji spares Luffy due to his defeat with  Crocodile stating they are even but wonders if Luffy only wanted to buy time for the others or really thought he could beat him. However, he does not pursue the Going Merry stating that the crew will be destroyed by Robin sooner or later anyway. As he leaves, he considers giving Luffy a message from  Smoker but states it would be too confusing (and Luffy would not be able to hear since he is frozen). Luffy is later found by the rest of the crew and is, like Robin, defrosted. However, Usopp is exhausted by all this and wonders if more opponents this strong will just keep appearing on their journeys stating he thinks he cannot handle the pressure anymore and they may be done for. Zoro says it does not matter since Luffy may have lost, but he became stronger from fighting Aokiji. The crew continues their journey three days later.

### __Water 7 Arc__

#### The City of Water: Arrival at Water 7[]

After being attacked by  Aokiji, the crew was fully recovered and had returned to sailing. Along their way, the crew saw a giant frog doing the crawl stroke and, wanting to eat it,  Luffy ordered everyone to make the ship follow after it. They ended up on some tracks underwater and were nearly run over by a train traveling on top of the water, and the frog was sent flying by it. They were amazed by this sight.

On a nearby station, they met with the stationmaster named  Kokoro and her granddaughter  Chimney, along with her pet rabbit (who acts like a cat)  Gonbe. After revealing that the frog,  Yokozuna, was perfectly fine and that it was always testing its strength against the train, Kokoro explained that the train was a  Sea Train that connects several of the nearby islands and is called the  Puffing Tom. She then told them that the  Log Pose would lead them to Water 7, a city of  shipwrights where they could fix their ship, and told them to get help from a man named  Iceburg.

The crew arrived at the city, which resembled a fountain, and sailed through the canals in the city looking for a place to dock, but the people were kind enough to tell them where to hide their boat. After stopping, a group of Luffy,  Nami, and  Usopp headed out to exchange their gold from  Skypiea and find a shipwright, using creatures called  yagaras to navigate the canals.

Later,  Robin and  Chopper left to look around, and  Sanji went by himself to do the same, leaving  Zoro on the ship. While Chopper was in a bookstore, a masked man walked past Robin and simply said, "CP9," which left her in shock. When Chopper came out, Robin was gone.

Meanwhile, several bounty hunters came onto the  Going Merry to claim the bounty on the crew, but they underestimated Zoro's power and were quickly defeated.

Luffy's group managed to exchange the gold for 300,000,000 and they went to Dock One of the  Galley-La Company. There, they met  Kaku, one of the foremen, who revealed that Iceburg was the mayor of Water 7, and the president of Galley-La. Kaku did not know where Iceburg was, so he decided to inspect their ship in the meantime, using immense speed and leaping capabilities to rocket across the city. Just after Kaku left, Iceburg and his secretary,  Kalifa, introduced themselves to the three and he agreed to work on their ship.

However, as they were about to enter the dock, the crew found that all of their money was gone, and they saw it being taken by several people. Luckily, at that moment, another foreman,  Paulie, was running from tax collectors and knocked the robbers off of their yagara bulls, but was about to use the money to pay his debt before another foreman,  Rob Lucci, stopped him. Iceburg revealed that the thieves (and the men who attacked Zoro) were known as the  Franky Family, a gang of dismantlers that bounty hunt and steal on the side and were led by a powerful man named  Franky.

Meanwhile, Sanji saw Robin with the masked man from before, but when they turned the corner, he found that they were gone. He later met up with Chopper and they started looking for Robin.

Meanwhile, in  Dock One, while Usopp was separated from the group, he was attacked by the Franky Family and the 200,000,000 he had was taken.

Kaku returned from his inspection of the ship and revealed a startling factâthe Going Merry was impossible to fix. Since the keel was broken, trying to fix it would be no different from making a new ship entirely. Though Luffy complained about this, Iceburg told him to think about it for a while. The empty suitcases containing the money Usopp carried were found, and they concluded the Franky Family was the cause, so Luffy rushed off aimlessly into the city while Nami headed back to the ship after finding out about the location of their headquarters from the Galley-La workers.

On the way, however, Nami found Usopp bloody and battered on the street, and he deeply regretted letting them take the money. She left him there for now so she could get everyone else and explained the situation to the others, including Sanji and Chopper who had returned to the ship.

At the  Franky House, the dismantlers' headquarters, the stolen money was presented to Franky himself, who revealed that the amount would be enough to buy what they had always wanted and left his gang a bunch of money to party with. As he was about to leave, the door exploded as Usopp walked in demanding that he give the money back. After a failed attempt to attack Franky, the others ganged up on Usopp.

The other Straw Hats went to where Nami left Usopp, but all they could find was bloody footsteps as Luffy fell from the sky. After he explained that he was trying to leap across the city like Kaku, he was told the situation. Outside of the Franky House, Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper found Usopp even worse off than before. The four battled the Franky Family, destroying the building, but they found that Franky had already left with most of the money. At this point, Luffy decided to abandon the Going Merry and buy a new ship.

#### Leaving Friends Behind: The Crew Splits Apart[]

At the Going Merry, Usopp's wounds are treated, and the news is broken to him that they will change ships. At first, Usopp thinks they are joking but when it's confirmed to be true, he asks if it is because he lost the money, but Luffy insists that the money would not have made any difference, and the ship can no longer sail. Usopp gets angry and insists that the Going Merry is just as much of a crewmate as everyone else, yelling that Luffy would trust strangers he met just that day and abandon a friend that was with them from the beginning.

Luffy insists that he thought long and hard to make the decision and that if Usopp does not like the way he captains then he should just leave. Sanji manages to get Luffy to calm down and the captain apologizes for what he said, but Usopp says those were his true feelings and states that if they are going to abandon Merry, they'll have to leave him behind too. As Usopp leaves the ship, with everyone else looking on tearfully, he turns around and challenges Luffy to a duel over control of the ship at 10:00 that night.

On the ship, Nami tries to convince Luffy to resolve the matter with words, but Luffy points out that Usopp is not the type to arbitrarily put his life on the line for things he did not strongly believe in. Once he issued the challenge, there was no turning back. Meanwhile, Sanji yells at Zoro for letting the Franky Family escape after they attacked him, because if they did not steal the money from Usopp none of this would have happened, but Nami gets them to calm down.

True to his word at ten o'clock that night Usopp came back to the ship for his duel. The fight begins and Usopp mostly uses his weaker attacks like the  and , but at it turns out these were simply to set up for several brand-new attacks. Usopp reveals that his strategy is to not even give Luffy a chance to attack and manages to get in several damaging hits in, though Luffy manages to hit him with a .

After being hit by a humongous explosion caused by shooting a  into a cloud of explosive gas stored in a Breath Dial, Luffy charges towards Usopp while doing his  attack, but Usopp absorbs the blow into his Impact Dial. Usopp then hits Luffy with the full force of his own attack, thinking he won, but Luffy manages to land on his feet and brings Usopp down with a . Despite being the winner, Luffy lets Usopp have the Going Merry and has the rest of the crew leave the ship.

The next morning, the entire city is in a frenzy with news that Iceburg was shot. Upon hearing this at the hotel they are staying in, Luffy and Nami decided to see the mayor while the others keep looking for Robin.

At the ruins of Franky House, Franky returns and concludes that the Straw Hats were behind this. As it turns out, the other Franky Family members were hoping their boss would want to avenge them and were keeping tabs on the pirates. They tell Franky that Luffy is heading for Dock One.

Meanwhile, Iceburg manages to wake up and identify his attackersâone was a large man wearing a mask, while the other was Nico Robin of the Straw Hat Pirates. At the same time, it is announced around the town that  Aqua Laguna, an annual high tide that engulfs the lower part of the city is coming, so Kokoro, Chimney, and her rabbit come to Water 7.

At Dock One, Franky attacks Luffy with a flame attack, leading the two pirates to believe he's a  Devil Fruit user, until he jumps straight into the canal and attacks from there. After trading several more attacks, Franky reveals that he's a cyborg, a human with robotic parts. Before the fight can go on for much longer, however, the Galley-La foremen intervene. At first, Luffy and Nami think they are helping fend off Franky, but then they start attacking Luffy. They reveal that the Straw Hat Pirates are behind the assassination attempt and are trying to arrest Luffy. After much fighting, with Luffy not fighting back, Franky gets tired of everyone ignoring him and unleashes his ultimate attack, , to destroy the entire dock. Luffy and Nami take this chance to escape and Luffy decides to see if Iceburg was telling the truth about Robin being his attacker.

Meanwhile, the Galley-La workers search through the town for the other crewmates and the Iceburg's statement is printed in all of the newspapers. At the company's headquarters, and where Iceburg lives, Luffy breaks in and rushes around the building looking for the mayor's room, avoiding the attacks of the shipwrights there. Iceburg hears about this and has Kalifa lead Luffy to his room.

When the two meet, Iceburg confirms that he really saw Nico Robin and then pulls out a gun, requesting that Luffy let him see her. Luffy says that he has no idea where she is and Iceburg shoots, attracting the attention of the other workers, though Luffy manages to escape before they get there.

Meanwhile, Chopper and Sanji find Robin. Robin explains that there is a darkness in her heart that will engulf the rest of the crew if she stays any longer and declares that she is leaving. Sanji tells Chopper to go back and tell everyone what happened, but he has something else he needs to do.

Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper gather together and reach the conclusion that Robin may be being forced to do everything by the man in the mask, but Zoro points out that it would not be good to have false hope. Either way, they conclude that there will be another attack that night and they should confront her there.

Meanwhile, Franky decides to bring Luffy out of hiding by kidnapping Usopp and stealing the ship.

At the Galley-La headquarters, all of the workers and foremen gather to protect their director.

#### The Masked Assassins: CP9 Strikes[]

In the Galley-La headquarters, Iceburg calls Paulie into his room to tell him something, and afterwards Paulie leaves his guard post to go into another room, opening a hidden safe. The four remaining Straw Hats gather outside of headquarters hiding in a tree, observing the building for any events out of the ordinary when there is a huge explosion. At that point, several masked men in costumes (including Robin) rush into the building, who the workers assume are Straw Hat pirates.

Nami, Chopper, and Zoro decide to break in too, only to find that Luffy is gone.

While the female assassin distracts the guard, showing incredible speed and the ability to jump while airborne, the man with Robin, wearing a bear mask, manages to enter Iceburg's room from the side using his  Doa Doa no Mi. He shoots Iceburg to weaken him, stating that they cannot kill him until they get the signal, and leaves him to Robin while he handles the guards. The bear masked man easily takes care of the foreman  Tilestone, demonstrating an ability to make his body as hard as metal.

At this point, Iceburg reveals the identities of the attackersâthey are the government agency Cipher Pol 9, who intentionally failed in the first assassination attempt in order to place the blame on the Straw Hats, and they are after the blueprints for the ancient weapon  Pluton, which Iceburg owns through inheritance from the great shipwright  Tom.

Meanwhile, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper break into the building, thinking that Luffy would have distracted all of the guards by aimlessly rushing in, only to find themselves surrounded.

As it turns out, Luffy got stuck between two buildings.

Meanwhile, Paulie pulls blueprints out of Iceburg's safe only to encounter two men in a bull and skull mask. Paulie attacks them only to be beaten easily, but as it turns out the blueprints are fake. Using  Den Den Mushis, the other CP9 agents are alerted to gather in Iceburg's room. In Iceburg's room, the four CP9 agents reveal their identitiesâthe foremen Lucci and Kaku, the secretary Kalifa, and the bar owner  Blueno.

At this time, however, Luffy manages to get free and breaks into the room only to be caught off guard by the powers of CP9, which include the ability to fire an "air blade" from their legs. Luffy and Paulie are pinned to the ground, but after talking for a bit, Luffy manages to squeeze himself out and release Paulie.

Meanwhile, Zoro fends off the shipwrights using the backs of his swords and he, along with Nami and Chopper, make their way upstairs.

Iceburg refuses to cooperate with the CP9 so Lucci (who, as it turns out, can speak normally), asks Kaku to check Iceburg's pulse to gauge his reaction to his "theory." Lucci gives his theory as to what happened to the Pluton blueprints. It was assumed that Iceburg was the last apprentice of the shipwright Tom and inherited the blueprints as a result, since reports said that his other apprentice, Cutty Flam, died when he was run over by the Sea Train. However, Cutty Flam is not actually deadâhe continues to live in the city to this very day under the name Franky. When he hears this, Iceburg's pulse greatly quickens and Lucci concludes that he was right.

Just as CP9 is about to leave to go after Franky; Luffy, Paulie, Zoro, Chopper, and Nami break into the room. When Paulie finds out the situation, he attacks Lucci only to be beaten easily. Lucci reveals that all CP9 agents are capable of using " Rokushiki", the six martial art techniques, to put them beyond any other human. The Straw Hats try to talk to Robin, but she leaves stating that there's a wish she cannot accomplish when with them.

As it turns out, CP9 had set a firebomb in the building to go off soon, but before that Lucci decides to show off his Devil Fruit power, the  Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard. Luffy and Zoro attack him, only to be thrown across the island, and the building is engulfed in flames, with Iceburg and Paulie tied up unconscious, Nami thrown outside, and Chopper buried under rubble inside.

At this point, the four CP9 agents leave and come across several Franky Family members, who are yelling around town that they have Usopp and the ship captive and that Luffy has to go to the workplace under the bridge if he wants to see them again. Lucci beats them up to find an exact location and the agents head for Franky's hiding place.

Meanwhile, at Franky's hide-out, Usopp continues to fix the ship while Franky and his assistants, the Square Sisters, cry from his story. When Franky asks what Usopp plans on doing once he fixes his ship, he replies that he's going back to  Syrup Village in  East Blue after adventuring for a bit longer. Franky tells him that he cannot let him do that, since the ship will not even reach the next island, nonetheless go back to East Blue, and suggests letting him dismantle it. After arguing, Franky throws Usopp into the water under the ship so he can see for himself that the ship is too damaged to go anywhere. Even after resurfacing, Usopp continues fixing the ship and reveals that he already knew the ship was doomed.

He tells them that in Skypiea, the night after the ship was heavily damaged by  Priest Shura, Usopp saw a strange figure in the fog fixing it, telling Usopp, "Don't worry, I'll carry everyone a little longer." The next day, though crudely done, the ship was fixed and back in its original form without the upgrades made by the  Saruyama Alliance. Not only was it odd that someone would be there to help them, but that they would know what the ship originally looked like, which led Usopp into thinking that the figure was the Going Merry's soul.

Franky confirms this suspicion, telling Usopp about the  Klabautermann, a ship spirit that appears to warn and even save crewmembers when the ship is near destruction and only appears if the ship loves the crew it carries. Franky points out that if Usopp traveled on the ship and ended up dying when it fell apart, the Going Merry's soul would not be able to live with itself, but Usopp asks Franky if he should just leave behind a friend when he is about to die.

Before this discussion can go on much longer, the four CP9 members break in, knocking out the  Square Sisters. Franky recognizes them as being from the Galley-La Company and attacks them, asking them what they think they are doing there. Lucci reveals to him that they are from the government, and they know he is really Cutty Flam, also claiming that they killed Iceburg. The cyborg is then knocked through a wall, revealing a dusty workshopâthe place where Tom's Workers operatedâand the CP9 decide to look through it in search of the Pluton blueprints, tearing the room apart, but Franky tells them to get out of there.

#### Living with Pride: Franky's Past[]

Twenty-two years ago, a young Franky sails his newest ship only to be attacked by a  Sea King and his new weapons are ineffective against it. When he comes back onto shore, a young Iceburg scorns him for constantly making weapons as their mentor, a pufferfish fish-man named Tom, finishes up on a ship by tossing it into the air and throwing the masts in with great accuracy.

As they, along with Yokozuna the frog, eat food made by Kokoro, she explains how the island is not getting any business, and when they do the shipbuilding companies fight each other over customers, and with the water level steadily rising, all anyone can do is wait for the city to sink. That night, however, Tom works on his plan to fix this problem.

Later, after the execution of  Gol D. Roger, a judiciary ship arrives in the town to put Tom on trialâthey are arresting anyone who helped the late Pirate King, and Tom was the one who built his ship, the  Oro Jackson. Tom is about to be sentenced to be executed at  Enies Lobby until he reveals his plans: he will build a Sea Train that can travel in any weather to connect the nearby islands together.

After the judge requests a route to Enies Lobby, he gives Tom ten years to make the Sea Train before his trial is redone. Though Franky is angry that Tom would be arrested for making such a great ship that reached the end of the Grand Line in the first place,  Tom's Workers immediately gets to work. After ten years, the Puffing Tom makes its first successful launch.

Government agents, led by the leader of Cipher Pol 5,  Spandam, arrive at where Tom and Iceburg are, only to be shot by Franky's cannons. Spandam ignored as Franky exclaims that he finally made a ship strong enough to defeat a Sea King, but is once again yelled at by Iceburg, explaining that he cannot just leave such powerful weapons lying around. Spandam manages to get their attention again and talks with Tom personally. Spandam explains that he is after the blueprints for the Pluton, though Tom denies having them. The CP5 leader then threatens to reveal that Tom built Gol D. Roger's ship if he does not reveal where the plans are, only to be dumbfounded when Tom points out that everyone already knows that.

After the agents leave, Tom takes the blueprints out of a safe and entrust them to Iceburg and Franky. Franky suggests that they try to build it but is yelled at by Iceburg once again. Meanwhile, at a bar, Spandam laments that it is just not right for the builder of the Pirate King's ship to go free.

The next day, the judiciary ship comes back to give Tom a retrial and everyone is sure that Tom will go free this time, until the ship is attacked. As Franky watches in horror, the attacking ships turn out to be his own creations, and after the judiciary ship sinks Spandam orders the agents controlling the ships to return and jump off the ship. Tom and Iceburg board the ships once they stop attacking only to find that there is no one there and are shot by some more ships. Franky arrives to find them badly wounded and the three are arrested by CP5.

At the trial, Spandam claims that he was the one who saved everyone, and no one believes Franky when he declares that Spandam was the one who attacked in the first place. It is pointed out by the CP5 leader that the ships were made by their company, but Franky declares that no ship that hurts his friends like that is any ship of his, which Tom responds to by breaking out of his manacles and punching his apprentice for the first time. The fish-man declares that no matter what a ship does, even if it ends up bringing about the end of the world, the creator must love it with all of his heart.

He then runs up and attacks Spandam too only to be shot by tranquilizers. Since the creation of the Sea Train nullifies one crime, Tom requests that this one be erased, making it so that he will be executed for building the Oro Jackson but Franky and Iceburg are now safe. Franky and Iceburg are released and the first thing Franky does is take a tranquilizer gun from a nearby soldier and smashes in Spandam's face with it.

Franky then runs away as the soldiers attack him. Tom is taken onto the Sea Train, which is leaving for Enies Lobby, and Franky takes one of his boats farther down the track. As he stands on the track, with Yokozuna watching, he fires cannons at the train, but it will not stop. He then tries to stop it with his bare hands only to get run over, supposedly getting killed.

Four years later, Iceburg has managed to unite the shipping companies of the island and Water 7 is thriving once again. One day, Franky comes to Galley-La Headquarters requesting to talk to Iceburg only to be turned away.

Later that day, Iceburg meets with Franky in secret, and he gives him the Pluton blueprints after an argument. Iceburg requests that Franky leaves the island, but he refuses to do so.

#### Another Sea Train: Voyage to Enies Lobby[]

As Franky and Usopp are restrained by CP9, Franky is told that their commander would like to talk with him. As it turns out, the leader of CP9 is Spandam, who now has to wear a leather mask to cover his wounds, and he states that he will make Franky pay for what he did to him before. CP9 decide to arrest Usopp too, as even though he left the crew he still claims to be a pirate. Kaku then notices that they still have not gotten rid of the ship and releases it into the storm of Aqua Laguna.

Meanwhile, at the Galley-La Headquarters, Iceburg (who was saved by Chopper at the last minute inside the Galley La Headquarters) and Nami manage to regain consciousness and Iceburg requests to the other carpenters that they speak alone. Iceburg then reveals that Robin told him that CP9 could call for an island-destroying fleet of battleships known as the  Buster Call, thanks to permission from Aokiji, and that they would use it on the Straw Hat Pirates if Robin did not help assassinate Iceburg and come with them to be executed at Enies Lobby. In other words, the goal she cannot reach when with the Straw Hats is for the six crewmembers, excluding herself, to leave the island safely.

With the knowledge that Robin did not betray them, Nami rushes to wake up Chopper. Paulie wakes up and tells the other shipwrights that the pirates were not the assassins, but lies that he did not see who the attackers really were and that Lucci, Kaku, and Kalifa were at home. Nami rushes to stop the Sea Train, led by Paulie and several other Galley-La workers, while Chopper and other workers search for Luffy and Zoro.

At the Blue Station, the four CP9 agents, along with  Corgi and their prisoners, board the Sea Train as Sanji observes the situation. Due to the severe weather conditions, the Sea Train is forced to depart from the station early. As the train starts to leave, Sanji sneaks on board, but Nami and the others get there just in time to see it leave. Thankfully, the carpenters find a note from Sanji that states that he's on the train along with a Baby Den Den Mushi so they can contact each other once he finds a Den Den Mushi on the train. Thus, Nami switches her priorities to finding a ship to chase after them, but Paulie says it would be crazy to use a ship during Aqua Laguna.

During this, Kokoro watches the ocean, noting that the distance the water drawback shows how strong the following waves will be during Aqua Laguna. This year, the water draws back an abnormally large distance, giving the appearance of the ocean drying up. At this point, Chimney notices something in the back alleys and, as Nami approaches them, she points out that Luffy is stuck between two of the buildings. Meanwhile, Chopper looks at the back alley too and sees Zoro stuck in a chimney.

Both Nami and Chopper hop across the buildings to where each respective crewmate is. While Chopper tries to pull Zoro out of the chimney, handing Zoro his sword upon request, Nami yells to Luffy that Robin gave up her life so that they could escape the government's wrath. Luffy then pushes the buildings he was stuck between apart and Zoro slices in half the building whose chimney he was stuck in just as the first wave of Aqua Laguna crashes towards them. They just barely manage to reach higher ground only to underestimate the strength of the waves and are engulfed. Thankfully, Paulie was close by and manages to pull them up, but it is still not over as they have to quickly reach even higher ground before they are caught again. They succeed and the two crewmates are told about the situation.

Meanwhile, on Puffing Tom, Sanji tries to decide the best course of action when he is found by an agent. He kicks the agent through the cart, drawing the attention of everyone there. One of them suggests alerting CP9, but the CP6 agent  Jerry, a very tall man that needs to bend over to fit in the cart, says that there's no need to do that. He tries to fight Sanji only to be beaten without any effort. In the car where CP9 is staying, Corgi explains that in the 5th car is the Marine Captain  T Bone, in the 4th  Wanze of CP7, and finally in the 3rd the newest member of CP9,  Nero, making it so that there is no chance of any attackers reaching them.

Back at Water 7, Luffy decides that they are going to take a ship to chase after Robin, but Paulie points out it is useless since no ship can get past a normal Aqua Laguna and this year's is far beyond average.

At this point, Kokoro says that if any ship could get past this it would be the Sea Train, and tells the Straw Hats to follow her. She takes them to an old cellar where the prototype Sea Train,  Rocketman, was kept, and they find Iceburg finishing up on maintenance. He had the same idea as Kokoro and came to the warehouse earlier to get it ready, and the train is ready for departure. Luffy and Zoro manage to fully recover by eating a bunch of meat and sake brought by Nami and a pair of conductors.

Before they can leave, the Franky Family appears before them. They tearfully request to Luffy that they come with them to Enies Lobby so they can rescue Franky, and Luffy lets the group join them. As Luffy, Zoro, Nami, and Chopper get on board, with Kokoro conducting, the train launches out of one of the gates in the city straight into Aqua Laguna.

As the train launches out of the city, the Franky Family attaches their cart to the train, bringing along their king bulls Sodom and Gomorrah, and Kokoro steers the ship onto the tracks, greatly boosting its speed. Being a prototype, Rocketman's speed cannot be controlled and, once it gets on the tracks, it is almost impossible to steer. As it turns out, Chimney, Gonbe, Paulie, Tilestone, and  Lulu stowed onboard. After Paulie tells the other two foremen the identities of the assassins, he reveals that he came along to avenge Iceburg. Since they share a common enemy, the Straw Hat Pirates, Galley-La Company, and Franky Family officially form an alliance.

Meanwhile, on the Puffing Tom, Sanji breaches the next car, which is where Usopp and Franky are being kept. After being convinced that Franky is good by Usopp, Sanji reluctantly frees both of them and they climb on top of the next car, where Captain T Bone is stationed. Using a Den Den Mushi from the previous car, he calls Nami and is told about Robin's situation.

Back at the Rocketman, a huge wave is coming towards them and despite the best efforts of the Franky Family and the Galley-La Foremen, they cannot break it apart. At this point, Luffy and Zoro make their move by performing their ultimate combo attack, , and blast a huge tunnel through the wave, saving the train.

Though Franky decides to help rescue Robin, Usopp refuses to, citing that he is no longer a member of the crew, and walks away. Minutes later, however, a masked man in a cape who looks exactly like Usopp, calling himself "Sogeking", appears before them and says that Usopp told him about the entire situation and that he is willing to help. Sanji and Franky see right through his disguise, but decide not to say anything.

As Captain T Bone, a zombie-like but honorable knight swordsman, and his soldiers look through the last two cars, the three intruders detach them from the rest of the train, leaving very few people left. They enter the next car, which holds the kitchen, and encounter the CP7 chef Wanze, a very odd-looking and energetic man that makes ramen with his nose hairs and fights using Ramen Kenpo. Sanji holds him off as Franky and Sogeking continue to the next car.

Sanji battles Wanze and Franky faces off with Nero as Sogeking continues on to Robin's car by using suction octopi to walk along the side of the train. He tells Robin about the situation, but she still refuses to be saved. When Corgi comes in to see the source of the noise, Sogeking hides under Robin's cloak.

In the kitchen, Wanze proves to be very weak, but Sanji cannot hurt him with his kicks since his feet will get stuck in his ramen armor. The Straw Hat cook manages to bypass this, however, by using knives to cut the armor apart, stating that he's in a kitchen and he's cutting up food, so he can ignore his legs-only rule in this case.

After a while, Rocketman approaches the detached cars and, after Luffy makes sure Sanji and the others aren't not on it, Zoro cuts it in half to get it off the tracks. Soon afterwards, they come across Captain T Bone, who ran on ahead on the Sea Train tracks in a desperate attempt to stop the intruders. T Bone fires projectile slashes towards Zoro, but he manages to dodge them and knocks T Bone off the tracks.

On the top of Car 3, Franky is overwhelmed by Nero's speed, especially once he discovers that his back is his weak point, but through trickery Franky manages to pin him down. As the cyborg punches Nero through the roof, Sanji kicks Wanze through several cars until he lands right next to the CP9 agents.

In Robin's car, Corgi finds Sogeking, but he is shot by one of his Gunpowder Stars. Despite Sogeking trying to stop her, Robin goes into the car where CP9, Sanji and Franky are. She once again denies their help, even going as far as attacking the sniper king, but he throws a smoke bomb and the four criminals escape to the last car, detaching it from CP9's car. However, Kalifa manages to grab onto the car with her whip and it is pulled in by Blueno.

Franky sacrifices himself by breaking down the wall being held by Blueno and falling back into their car, but this is futile as Blueno teleports to the separated car with an "Air Door" using his Devil Fruit power. He attacks Sanji and Usopp, but Robin has him stop on the condition that she willingly goes with him. Before Sanji can counterattack, Blueno and Robin go into the air door back to the Sea Train.

Talking to Robin, Franky learns that Iceburg is still alive (Sogeking told her this) and then informs her that no matter what anyone says, simply being alive is not a sin. Puffing Tom then arrives at the no-night government island of Enies Lobby.

Yokozuna the frog appears on the tracks to test his strength against Rocketman and the impact separates the Franky Family's car from the train and knocks the train off the tracks. After landing on the train, Kokoro calls the frog over and he is extremely happy to see her, since he thought she was kidnapped by the government. Somehow managing to talk to the frog, Kokoro finds out that he was attacking the Sea Train so he could become stronger and so he will be able to stop his friends from being taken away again. She informs him that Franky was taken just like Tom was, and Yokozuna decides to accompany them to Enies Lobby.

Meanwhile, the Franky Family come across the cars Sanji and Sogeking were in and the two board theirs. As the sky starts to turn blue again, Enies Lobby comes in sight.

### __Enies Lobby Arc__

#### Assault on Enies Lobby: A Declaration of War

Reunited with  Sanji and Sogeking ( Usopp) shortly thereafter on the  Rocketman, the  Straw Hats, along with the  Franky Family and  Galley-La, began an all-out assault on the government island of  Enies Lobby against thousands of  Marine soldiers and the  Cipher Pol agents in a last-ditch effort to rescue their friends  Nico Robin and  Franky before they are dragged through the  Gates of Justice. The massive doors are the only thing standing between Robin and Franky and their respective destinations:  Marine Headquarters and the terrifying prison of  Impel Down.

While the others battled with the  giants  Oimo and  Kashii,  dog-riding guards,  monstrous jurors and a  three-headed judge,  Luffy rushes ahead and engages the numerous Marines and Agents on the island; in spite of their numbers and numerous wrong turns, he overpowers them and eventually reaches the roof of the courthouse. Meanwhile,  Spandam gloats with overconfidence until a Marine finally reports in that casualties are mounting at a horrendous rate: over 2,000 so far, with Luffy himself responsible for half that total. Furthermore, thanks to his previous contact with  Dorry and  Brogy, Sogeking was able to convince Oimo and Kashii to defect. For the first time, Spandam starts to panic. On the courthouse roof, Luffy encounters  CP9 agent  Blueno. Unlike last time, Luffy is able to keep track and match his skill. Then Luffy reveals his new  Gear 2 ability, which allows him to imitate the technique  Soru to great effect, enhances his body to withstand the strain while using it, and allows him to overpower Blueno's strongest  Tekkai technique, ultimately knocking him out. Franky used his  to free himself from his chains taking Robin with him. Luffy called out to Robin and told her that he was coming for her. She replied that she didn't want to be saved and that she just wanted to die.

The others finally catch up, and as the CP9 and Straw Hats face each other, Robin's past is finally revealed, as well as her last reason for being unwilling to return to the crew: having been betrayed so many times in the past, she's terrified that one day the Straw Hats will see her as a burden, and also betray her. She screams that she would prefer death to that. The other Straw Hats quietly acknowledged the reason Robin had, then Spandam burst out laughing, saying she's absolutely accurate, and nobody would be stupid enough to think she wasn't a burden after traveling with her. Spandam pointed at the flag on top of the  Tower of Justice and told Luffy that the organization after Robin is over 170 affiliated nations.

Luffy acknowledged this, then told Sogeking to shoot down the flag. Sogeking complied, utilizing his new  Kabuto weapon to launch a fiery missile at the flag, setting it ablaze and shocking Spandam, Robin, and all the Marines and Agents in Enies Lobby beyond words; the Straw Hat Pirates had just declared war on the  World Government. Spandam questioned Luffy's sanity, but he just bellowed back that he can take it, then tells Robin to admit that she wants to live. Unable to doubt her friends any longer after seeing them declare that her enemy is their enemy also, she tearfully begged them to take her out to sea with them.

At this point, the Franky Family finally managed to pull the levers, and the drawbridge between the courthouse and the Tower of Justice began to lower. The Straw Hats waited impatiently, while Spandam is terrified. However, Judge Baskerville ordered the personnel to fire the mortar cannon to forcibly stop the drawbridge.  Paulie and  Zambai attempted to stop him by cutting between his three heads, but it is revealed that they were three people in the same suit. The mortar cannon fired, stopping the drawbridge, and Spandam started to drag Robin, heading for the Gates of Justice, but Franky stopped him.

#### Find the Key: Invading the Tower of Justice

Franky, impressed by the nerve of the Straw Hats, and knowing he has misjudged Robin, revealed the blueprints that the government had been after. He explained that the architect who wrote the blueprints of  Pluton thought there should not exist a weapon like this without having a weapon against it in the case of it falling into the hands of someone like Spandam. Because he figured this was the only way to satisfy the wish of the architect, Franky then burned the blueprints right in front of CP9, telling them that he is betting on the Straw Hats' victory: if they lose, and Robin is taken, the world will end; but if they win, Spandam will be left with nothing. He told Luffy that he will help him with his fight. In anger, Spandam pushed Franky over the balcony, but  Kokoro contacts the Straw Hats and told them to jump into the waterfall. Luffy complied, bringing the rest of his crew with him, and they land on the Rocketman as it shoots off the half-open drawbridge. The train caught Franky on its front before plowing into the Tower of Justice.

Spandam is shocked, and immediately started to drag Robin away, heading to the Gates of Justice. Before he leaves, he tells CP9 that they have permission to massacre all of the invaders. He ordered  Rob Lucci to come with him to take Robin, since he needs to be protected, then called  Funkfreed, who  turned into a sword. Spandam reflected that with his specially reserved sword and the CP9, he should have nothing to fear.

The Straw Hats emerged from the wreckage of the Rocketman, having suffered only minor injuries. When they head towards the stairs, they are called by  Fukurou, who was in a corner of the room. He tells them that Robin is being taken to the Gates of Justice by Lucci and Spandam, and that CP9 has been given orders to eliminate them. He then showed them a key, which he explained is a key to Robin's  Seastone handcuffs. After a bit of conversation amidst the Straw Hats about this, Fukurou explained that Seastone is as hard as diamond, and the handcuffs could never be removed without the key.

Luffy attempted to get it back, but Fukurou evaded with . When he reappeared, he tells the crew that the key he has may or may not be the one to Robin's cuffs. He goes on to say that, including him, there are five CP9 members in the building, each with a key, and only one would release Robin's handcuffs. The Straw Hats would need to defeat all of CP9 to be sure that they had the right key.  Nami suggested that they retrieve Robin first, but Fukurou threatened to throw the key into the ocean if she does. Fukurou tells them that CP9 is giving them a chance, then fled into the building.

Luffy immediately started to run after Fukurou, but  Zoro and Sogeking hold him back, saying that they need to decide where they are going first. After clarifying that Lucci is "the pigeon guy", they decided to send Luffy on ahead to deal with him. Sanji stated that without Luffy, they have six people with them, and they'll need to defeat the five CP9 in the building before heading off to join Luffy. Sogeking worried that if Robin gets to the Gates of Justice, it's all over. Knowing it's a race against time, the Straw Hats rush off, with the determination to win their fights, even if they die trying.  Chimney and  Gonbe ran after them, wishing them luck, but then fell through a trapdoor. Kokoro, who had been drinking, wondered where they went.

Chimney and Gonbe end up in a candlelit secret passageway and heard something echoing from the other end. When they recognized it as Spandam's voice, they ran towards it. Spandam, with Lucci and Robin behind him, walked down a spiral staircase, Spandam laughing and taunting Robin all the while. Chimney and Gonbe emerged from a hidden door in the tower, then followed the group. They reached the bottom of the tower, finding a large, formidable-looking steel door with an electric lock. Spandam fumbled with the control panel for a few moments, during which Lucci noticed Chimney and Gonbe, but does nothing. The door opened, revealing a very long corridor.

Franky ran through the tower, looking for the kitchen to refill his cola supply. He finally finds it, but Fukurou blocked his way. Nami encountered  Kumadori in a dungeon, and Sogeking tried a number of doors before coming across a garden where  Jabra is sleeping with the key lying on the ground in front of him. Sanji runs into an apparently empty room, but  Kalifa revealed herself and effortlessly seduced Sanji into taking tea with her. Zoro, swords at the ready, confronted  Kaku in his study.

Luffy, finally having found the right path through the maze of staircases within the tower, arrived at the top of the Judicial Tower, but finds that Fukurou was telling the truth and Robin had already left. Spandam, explained that even if Luffy were to catch up to them, he would not know how to get across to the Gate. Kaku, claiming to be CP9's best  swordsman, tested his  four-sword style against Zoro. After a duel revealed them to be evenly matched, he declared Zoro a worthy opponent, and uses his newfound  Devil Fruit abilities for the first time.

Meanwhile, Sogeking tried to steal the key from the sleeping Jabra without a fight. Before he can reach it, however, a rooster appeared and chirps, startling him into making noise that woke Jabra up. He recognized Sogeking as a pirate and attacks him, revealing his  Devil Fruit ability:  Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Wolf. The fight is then interrupted by the room's ceiling collapsing.

Zoro fell down, followed by Kaku, whose Devil Fruit gives him the form of a giraffe. However, his inexperience with his new powers caused him to accidentally transform into the full animal form rather than the hybrid. Jabra finds Kaku's new appearance very funny indeed, and they get into an argument until Zoro reminded Kaku of their fight. He subsequently changed into his hybrid form, but his appearance makes Zoro lose his focus, and made Jabra laugh even harder. Noticing their distraction, Sogeking tried to immobilize the assassins with a pair of Seastone handcuffs he finds, but only succeeded in hitting Zoro, as his aim was spoiled by laughing at Kaku. The latter, annoyed that everybody is laughing at him, lost his temper and cut the tower in half with his  Rankyaku: Amane Dachi. Zoro and Sogeking avoid the attack but find themselves accidentally locked together by the Seastone handcuffs. Since Kaku and Jabra cannot decide who gets to kill their opponents while they are handcuffed together, they offered to unlock the two to avoid getting into another argument. Sadly, neither of them had the correctly numbered key, with Kaku having Number 5 and Jabra having Number 1, so they resign themselves to fighting both of them.

Meanwhile,  Chopper managed to find the room where Zoro and Sogeking are fighting. They tell Chopper that he must find one of the other CP9 members and get the number 2 key. Chopper ran off, hoping that Sanji will have the right key. In the dungeon, Kumadori has Nami trapped with his hair attacks, giving her no opportunity to use her  Clima-Tact.

Franky, low on cola and thus unable to use any  special attacks, is forced to box with Fukurou. They compared the strength of their punches and find themselves evenly matched in strength and toughness. After three cups of tea, Sanji came to his senses and demanded Kalifa's key. She took advantage of his reluctance to hurt women and kicked him across the room.

Finally, Luffy reached the bottom of the Judicial Tower, where he can see the Gates of Justice in front of him. The only problem is that between him and the Gates is a giant whirlpool.

Nami is nearly killed by Kumadori before Chopper attacked him to rescue her, and she escaped having stolen Kumadori's key. Sanji suddenly fell from an upper story, his body terribly wounded and deformed by some unknown power into a doll-like figure. He explained his plight to Nami, who gently chastised him for his foolishness before advancing to face Kalifa herself.

At the Gates of Justice, Luffy nearly drowned trying to cross the ocean by himself, but is rescued by Gonbe and Chimney, who led him to a secret passage that Spandam had used earlier. It led to the lower areas of the tower, and eventually to an immovable steel door. Luffy broke through it with his new  Gear 3. The attack was not shown, but afterwards his body is briefly shrunk to child-size.

Luffy returned to normal as he pursued Lucci and Spandam. Lucci informed his commander that they are being followed, and Spandam ordered him to wait behind to hold off any pursuit while he takes Robin to the Gates of Justice.

#### One on One: Straw Hat Pirates vs CP9

Meanwhile, Franky and Fukurou's battle continued into the kitchen, each one trying to punch harder than the other. As the two swapped blows and taunts, Franky began to flag due to lack of cola, but their fight was interrupted by Kumadori and Chopper, who burst in through one wall. Chopper's first  Rumble Ball has worn off, so he stalled Kumadori by locking him in an enormous fridge. He joined forces with Franky, and after "accidentally" giving the cyborg the wrong drink several times, Chopper gave Franky a full cola refill. Franky, now super-charged, punched Fukurou out of the building, and their fight continued outside, taking them down into the ocean and then high above the Tower, where Franky ended the fight with his  Coup de Vent cannon. Franky then grabs the Number 4 key off of Fukurou's coat pocket.

Zoro and Usopp are still handcuffed together and running from Kaku and Jabra as best they can. The two agents managed to get into another argument in the process, giving Zoro and Usopp a chance to form a planâif Zoro cannot hold a sword with Usopp on his arm, Usopp must 'become' his sword and be used as a weapon instead. Usopp reluctantly agreed.

Back in the kitchen, Kumadori escaped from the fridge by eating his way out, and confronted Chopper, who is forced to eat another Rumble Ball in the hope of beating this powerful enemy. However, eating two Rumble Balls in such a short time made his transformations random and erratic, leaving him open to attacks. In the end even his strongest attack could not defeat Kumadori, and he fell, badly wounded.

In the moment before Kumadori finished him, he remembered the last time he took three Rumble Balls in a row, and how he woke up to hear that a monster had destroyed much of his village. His mentor  Dr. Kureha had told him that the monster had been him and made him promise to never do it again. With an apology to Kureha, and hoping that his friends aren't nearby, he took a third Rumble Ball, and grew into a gigantic, terrifying  monster that dwarfs Kumadori. He crushed the CP9 agent and threw him from the Tower of Justice to the main island.

In Kalifa's room, Nami's battle seemed to have ended prematurely - she lay paralyzed on the floor as Kalifa calmly took a bath. Nami, recovering her strength, tried to attack the CP9 agent, who defended herself with her newfound Devil Fruit powers - she is revealed to have eaten the  Awa Awa no Mi, which allows her to create bubbles which can weaken enemies, harden into soap for defense, or transmute an enemy's body entirely (as in the case of Sanji). Having worked this out, Nami continued to fight, but is soon weakened by Kalifa's bubbles.

Down in the basement, Luffy finally caught up to Lucci, who held him at bay while Spandam escaped towards the Gates of Justice with Robin. When Robin tried to escape, Spandam attempted to summon CP9 with his ordinary  Den Den Mushi but used the  Golden Den Den Mushi by mistake, which summons the  Buster Call, a powerful Marine fleet with orders to destroy the entire island. Realizing his mistake, Spandam contacted all the Marines stationed on the island, ordering them to report in. Meanwhile, Marine Headquarters receives the Buster Call signal on the Silver Den Den Mushi. Noting the target to be Enies Lobby, they decide to launch the fleet straight from headquarters so as to reach there within 30 minutes.

Spandam, at first panicking and not realizing that he is still on air, started to gloat that the lives of the Marines do not matter as long as he can bring Robin alive to the Gates of Justice. Robin cut in on his broadcast with a warning to the Marines. Understandably alarmed, the listening Marines evacuated the island, leaving the Franky Family and Galley-La workers behind as prisoners.

Hearing Robin's warning, Luffy tried to force his way past Lucci to reach her, but Lucci fought back fiercely and stopped him in his tracks, forcing him to continue the fight. Jabra and Kaku decided to end their fight with Zoro and Usopp quickly in order to escape the approaching bombardment.

In Kalifa's room, Nami struggled against the superior skill and powers of her opponent, who began to transmute Nami's body just like she did with Sanji. Before she can finish Nami off, however, Chopper broke into the room, still in monstrous form and totally out of control. The giant Chopper attacked Nami wildly, uprooting Kalifa's bath in the process. He threw it down the stairs to where Sanji lay unconscious below, drenching the whole area with water before storming off. The water from the bath washed away Kalifa's weakening bubbles; A splash on Nami's leg let her realize how to restore herself using . She then used  to confuse Kalifa before eventually defeating her with a  and taking her key.

Meanwhile, Chopper wandered into Zoro and Sogeking's fight, and Zoro fought to protect him from Jabra and Kaku. Franky arrived and decided that the only way to stop Chopper is to knock him into the ocean to cancel his Devil Fruit powers. He blew Chopper out of the tower with his , then jumped in after to save him. Nami unlocked Zoro and Sogeking's handcuffs, allowing the real fight against Jabra and Kaku to begin.

Robin tried to escape from Spandam, but he stopped her by attacking with Funkfreed.

With Chopper back to normal, safe, and out of the water, Franky remembered that Nami told him to head towards the Gates of Justice to try Fukurou and Kumadori's keys on Robin's handcuffs, so Chimney and Gonbe showed him the way.

Zoro began to once again battle Kaku. Kaku revealed more impressive abilities through the use of his Devil Fruit, using his nose as a larger version of  Shigan; the deflected blow easily cut into a boulder nearby.

Usopp tried frantically to defend himself against Jabra, but even his new Kabuto is no match for the CP9 agent's speed. Jabra caught Usopp off guard by offering him the key without a fight, but attacked Usopp at the last moment, knocking him down. With his opponent helpless, Jabra began to gloat at Usopp's weakness, but is cut short by the sudden arrival of Sanji, returned to his normal self by the falling water from Kalifa's bath. He distracted Jabra and told the wounded Usopp to help any way he can.

Outside, the  Sea Train departed, filled to capacity with escaping Marines. Meanwhile, Paulie (who used his rope skills to pretend he was bound) managed to untie the other captives, and they tried to find an alternative way off the island.

Fighting Sanji on the tower's high landing, Jabra revealed his  Tekkai Kenpo - a fighting style which allows him to move and fight while using Tekkai, making him all but immune to Sanji's kicks. Suddenly Jabra stopped the fight, tearfully offering Sanji his key and telling him that Robin is really his long-lost sister. Sanji ignored the deception and continued the fight.

Meanwhile, Usopp, high above on the tower, came up with a plan.

To combat Jabra's impenetrable Tekkai, Sanji creates a new technique,  Diable Jambe, where he heats up one foot with friction, resulting in powerful kicks that burn through his enemy's defense. He kicked Jabra all the way down to the ground floor, defeating him.

Meanwhile, Spandam dragged Nico Robin across the Bridge of Hesitation, a long bridge that leads to the Gates of Justice. Franky caught up to Luffy and Lucci and asks Luffy if he needed help. Luffy snapped at him, telling not to interfere. He told Franky to take the keys and head to where Robin is, behind the door Lucci is guarding.

Zoro and Kaku continued their duel, with Kaku using his Devil Fruit power to gain the upper hand, wounding Zoro with a rain of Rankyaku attacks. Zoro stalled Kaku by mocking his voice. Angry now, and experimenting wildly with his transformations, Kaku changed to a more powerful form, which removes his long neck while lengthening his arms and legs. Combined with larger swords he retrieved, Kaku gained the upper hand and mocked Zoro's attempt to rescue Robin.

This angered Zoro, prompting him to unleash a new mysterious technique,  Nine Sword Style, which made him appear like an Asura deity; three faces plus six arms meant nine swords total. Realizing the danger, Kaku prepared his finishing blow, the powerful Rankyaku attack that sliced the tower in half. Zoro countered with , which was so powerful it negated Kaku's Rankyaku and finally incapacitated the CP9 agent. In the end, Zoro delivers Paulie's message of termination, and the downed Kaku freely gave Zoro his key and even shared a joke with the man who defeated him. At this moment, Sanji catches up to Zoro and learns the last key is now theirs.

Robin admitted she is afraid of death, and tried to escape, even biting down on the bridge to stall for time. At the same time, she insisted in her mind that the crew will be coming to save her.

#### Survive the Buster Call: Luffy vs Lucci

Luffy is unable to hurt Lucci, who hit him with a rapid-fire Shigan. Franky comes to Luffy's aid by trying to hit Lucci with the same  move he used against Fukurou. Franky's move is unsuccessful against Lucci's much-stronger Tekkai, and Lucci prepared to strike Franky. Luffy used his  ability and knocked Lucci away. Franky was astonished by Luffy's strength and power, and encouraged him to defeat Lucci. Luffy manages to keep the now  transformed Lucci at bay and allowed Franky to leave the room to chase after Spandam and Robin.

On the bridge, Spandam dragged Robin by a rope, gloating that no one will ever reach her because he set up landmines behind them. He then explained that his father,  Spandine, was the one who led the destruction of  Ohara, which infuriated Robin. There is an explosion as Franky triggered the landmines and is blown into the water, and Spandam laughed that no one will save Robin.

Spandam is suddenly hit in the head by a missile, and the Marines waiting to transport the prisoner are also attacked. Sogeking had fired the shots from the top of the Tower of Justice, a distance that none of the Marines could hit with any weapon and none could see without binoculars.

Robin escaped and the Marines fired at her, but Franky jumped in the way to block the bullets (the landmines had only delayed him). Sogeking shot Zoro and Sanji's keys to Franky, leaving him with all of the keys to use on Robin's cuffs (the Number 5 key was the right one). Spandam is shocked that CP9 was defeated. With all the keys in hand, Franky eventually unlocks Robin's Seastone cuffs. Robin thanks Sogeking but he replied that she should save the thanks until later. Sogeking also tells Robin that she is now free to do whatever she wants, and Robin made her decision. Using her  Devil Fruit abilities she attacked Spandam.

The celebration is cut short when the Buster Call arrived, and the top of the Judicial Tower is blown up. The defensive fence surrounding Enies Lobby is also destroyed. Franky shouted out that this is their last chance to escape, as there is an escort ship at the end of the bridge. In the tunnels beneath the towers, Nami, Kokoro (carrying Chopper on her head), Chimney and Gonbe continued their escape.

The battle with Luffy and Lucci raged on. Luffy is able to land an attack on Lucci, who is forced back with pain. Lucci then explained to Luffy that his  ability is wearing his body away and shortening his life span by pumping blood into his legs, causing his blood-flow to speed up. Luffy yelled back that he does not care and wishes to save his comrades first. So Lucci raised the stakes and used a Rankyaku to smash a wall, causing water to flow into the tower and the tunnel system below; anyone in it (namely any of Luffy's comrades trying to catch up to him) will drown.

Spandam ordered the Marines to take back Robin, but the Marines stopped as they see the Buster Call approaching. The Buster Call is now upon Enies Lobby and is about to destroy everything. The fleet appears along with the five  Vice Admirals.

The Buster Call Marines explain that they can destroy everything but the bridge on Enies Lobby, because Robin is standing there, although Spandam thinks it is because of his presence. It is revealed that during the last Buster Call, everything on Ohara was destroyed except for the ground where Spandine was standing.

The Franky Family continued to rush to the Gates of Justice; meanwhile, Sogeking (blown off from the attack on the tower) falls to where Sanji and Zoro are located. They tried to get Sogeking to leave, but he is slowed by injuries. He tried to explain the properties of Kabuto, but is cut off by Sanji. Nami, Chopper, Kokoro, Chimney, and Gonbe are under the room where Lucci and Luffy are fighting, which is also filling up with water.

Having exhausted himself, Luffy is attacked fiercely by Lucci, who taunted that he thought Luffy was stronger. So Luffy unleashes , briefly explaining how it works. His arm then swelled to massive proportions, and he attacked Lucci with a  Gomu Gomu no Gigant Pistol, sending him flying through the wall and toward the sea.

A Marine asked Vice Admiral  Doberman how to handle the capture of Nico Robin. The Vice Admiral ordered him to ignore her and began to explain about Lucci's past.

15 years ago, an incident happened where 500 soldiers were captured on an island by pirates. The pirateâs captain wanted to become the king of the island in return for sparing the soldiers' lives. Just as the island was about to fall, the World Government sent a boy to the island. The boy infiltrated the pirate's hideout and killed the 500 soldiers on the spot. The pirates, infuriated, began to shoot at the boy. The boy emerged from the explosions, killed the pirate's captain and ended the incident. That boy, at the age of 13, became a member of CP9, and has become the strongest killing machine since CP9âs inception.

The Marines, upon hearing the story, became frightened. The Vice Admiral tells the Marines that as long as that man is here assisting in the recapture of Nico Robin, they do not need to act, and will do nothing until all but the Bridge of Hesitation is destroyed. In the tunnels, Zoro, Sanji and Sogeking heard the sound of water, and see Nami, Kokoro (with Chopper on her hat), Chimney, and Gonbe running away from the rushing water. The water began to fill up the passage, engulfing them all.

Lucci, after receiving a  attack, is knocked out, and landed on one of the Marine's ships. After recovering, Lucci returns to human form and takes off his shirt, showing scars on his back similar to the World Government's symbol. Luffy inhaled deeply and then attacked the ship. The Marines fired at him, but Luffy was unaffected.

Luffy resumed his fight with Lucci, attacking with a  , but Lucci managed to dodge it. He turned into his complete animal form and bit Luffy. Luffy escaped by expanding his body, while Lucci returned to his human form. Luffy tried to hit Lucci with a  , but Lucci dodged it as the attack destroyed the mast of the ship. Lucci fired a  Tobu Shigan Bachi and hit Luffy, and deduced that Luffy's speed decreases as his strength increases. The ship starts to split while Lucci laughed boldly.

Vice Admiral  Onigumo noted Lucci and Luffy fighting and ordered the fleet to target the ship they are on. He explained that if it's Lucci, then he will survive. A Marine objected to the idea, saying that 1,000 Marines are aboard the ship. The Vice Admiral killed the Marine on the spot, asking if he can protect the future from a criminal with his weakness. The ships begin firing, and the ship that Luffy and Lucci is on is hit. Luffy escaped the bombardment, returning to the tower. However, when he lands, he is shrunk from the side effects of Gear 3. He then hid from Lucci until he could return to normal size.

Spandam mocked the pirate, thinking Luffy died in the attack, and continued to brag about the Buster Call until Franky punched him in the face. Angry, Spandam tried to attack Robin with Funkfreed in elephant form, but is stopped by Franky, who threw the animal back right on top of Spandam.

Lucci found Luffy and began to attack him. However, right before Lucci could strike the finishing blow, the damage from the Gear 3 attack starts to hurt. As he struggled with the pain, Luffy returned to normal. In the tunnels, Zoro and the others slowly drown. As they neared death, Kokoro saved them all by revealing her true identity as a mermaid.

Robin and Franky hijacked Spandam's escape ship, and Kokoro soon arrived, jumping into the ship with the unconscious Straw Hat crew. Robin and Franky thank her as she changed back into a human and their friends woke up, but they realized they still need to wait for Luffy.

Meanwhile, Oimo and Kashii, who had been carrying Zambai,  Mozu and Kiwi, the rest of the Franky Family, Paulie,  Lulu,  Tilestone,  Sodom,  Gomorrah, and  Yokozuna out of the path of the Buster Call, finally reached the exit of Enies Lobby. However, they are attacked by three Buster Call ships; hit by cannon fire, the Straw Hats' allies tumbled into the waterfall below.

Luffy, still having trouble with Lucci, used  once more to even the odds. The Straw Hats and Franky continued to wait on the ship for Luffy. They heard an announcement from the Buster Call ships about the apparent deaths of their allies, leaving everyone, especially Franky, shocked. The group then discuss Luffy's fight with Lucci, claiming that Luffy always seems to know exactly which opponent he has to fight so they aren't overwhelmed.

Back at the battle, Lucci hits Luffy with the most powerful  Rokushiki  technique he knows, damaging Luffy heavily. However, it only leaves Luffy more determined than ever to defeat Lucci. Meanwhile, the Buster Call ships realized that Rob Lucci and Luffy are in the tower, so they destroyed half the bridge and isolated the tower. The fleet aimed at where the rest of the crew were waiting, to capture Nico Robin and Zoro and the rest of the crew. The crew get ready to fight back so that Robin will not be recaptured. The Marines are astonished by the crew, noting that one pirate crew was able to take down Enies Lobby and CP9.

Sogeking spotted Luffy and Lucci in the tower and called out to the pirate. Franky, Sogeking, Zoro, and Sanji, who are on the bridge, cheered him on. Newly motivated, Luffy prepares to fight Lucci again. Lucci, upon seeing the crew, remarked that it was quite the crew, but that evil cannot win.

As the fight of Luffy and Lucci continued, the Buster Call ships announced that 200  Captains and  Lieutenants will finish off the crew and recapture Nico Robin. As the pirates get ready to fight back, they realized that Sanji has gone missing. Nami exclaimed that they need to get off the ship as Chopper finds himself unable to move. On the bridge, Franky, Sogeking, and Zoro took on the Captains and Lieutenants, as Franky noticed that there are Devil Fruit users among them, making the fight more difficult. Zoro's sword  Yubashiri is broken during this fight. Robin and Nami fought off the Marines that attacked the ship.

Meanwhile, in the battle against Lucci, Luffy began to struggle as the effects of his  begin to show. Lucci taunts him that no matter how hard Luffy struggles, in the end, Luffy cannot take down Enies Lobby. Luffy attacked, but Lucci dodged his attack and landed another devastating . Luffy fell to the ground and attempting briefly to stand before collapsing in a pool of his own blood.

On the bridge, while fending off the attackers, Sogeking see Luffy's fall and froze. He finally takes off his mask and cried out for Luffy. Usopp encouraged Luffy to get up and to stop looking so defeated. Usopp tells Luffy that he came to save Robin, not to see Luffy being beaten up, and then challenged Lucci to a fight. Luffy stopped him, knowing that Usopp will be killed almost instantly. Now more determined than ever, Luffy got up again to fight,

Despite being attacked again and again by Lucci, Luffy still fought back. Lucci hit Luffy with another , but this time, Luffy does not fall. Using everything he has left, Luffy bombards Lucci with an all-out , crushing him through the tower wall and finally defeating him. After the Marines and the crew witness Lucci's defeat, Luffy fell to the floor, exhausted but triumphant. Luffy then calls out to Robin that they are going back together, causing her to tearfully smile.

#### Falling Snow of Reminiscence: Escaping Enies Lobby

The Marines are shocked at the loss of Rob Lucci, whom they considered to be the strongest in all of CP9's history. Usopp, Franky, and the rest of the crew, letting out a sigh of relief, began to congratulate Luffy and his victory.

Suddenly, a Den Den Mushi from somewhere transmitted a mysterious voice, which also congratulated Luffy. Knowing that they are being heard by everybody, they reveal themselves to be the Franky Family, Galley-La shipwrights, Yokozuna, Oimo and KÄshÄ«, dangling by Paulie's rope. They explain that the giants took all the shots for them, and that they are all safe. All of them begin climbing the rope, as Franky starts crying. Wiping the last of his tears, he yelled defiance at the Marines.

The Marines then realize that Luffy is seriously fatigued and has not been able to move, much to the crew's shock. Usopp encouraged Luffy again to move, but the latter cannot move at all. The Marines now noticed that the pirates are escaping through the escort ship, fire at it, and destroy the ship. The crew, realizing that Kokoro, Chimney, Gonbe and Chopper are still there, watched in horror as the ship starts sinking.

Suddenly, Sanji appeared, carrying all four of them. A Marine tries to capture Nami, but Kokoro knocked him out with a kick. The Buster Call ships start firing at Zoro and the others as they run from the explosions. The ships prepared to fire at Luffy in the tower. Robin tells everyone that, at this distance, even if she tried to pull him out of there, Luffy would just fall in the water. The crew begins to shout at Luffy, saying that he needs to get up.

As the rest of them shout at Luffy, Usopp noticed another voice. Franky yells at him that it is his family, but Usopp insisted that it is a different voice: one he recognizes. Luffy also heard the voice, hearing someone tell him to look below. The rest of the crew start hearing the mysterious voice, as the Marines starts the countdown. Usopp urged them to jump to the sea, asking Robin to help move Luffy.

Zoro says that it will kill him, but Usopp says that they still have a friend among them, which left Zoro speechless. Two seconds remain in the countdown as Robin moved Luffy towards the sea. Chopper started to cry as he sees a familiar figure, coming up from the water. Sanji, Nami, and Chopper cry as  Going Merry arrives, telling them to return to the "sea of adventure".

Kokoro threw Chopper, Robin, and Luffy onto the Going Merry before boarding herself. Spandam returned, broken and bruised from being hit with Funkfreed, and orders the Marines to open fire on Merry, falsely claiming to have permission from  Admiral  Aokiji. Two Buster Call ships fired, only to get caught up in a strong current and hit each other. Sanji, during his absence, had started to close the Gates of Justice, causing the whirlpool currents to return. As Nami used the current to elude the battleships, more shots are fired, which Zoro and Sanji deflected by using Luffy as a sling. Spandam yelled more orders, but Robin used her powers to break his spine. Finally, Franky used the  to catapult ship and all out of danger.

At the front of the island, the Franky Family, Galley-La, giants,  King Bulls, and Yokozuna commandeered the  Puffing Tom and return to  Water 7. Aokiji arrived on the scene and declared that with the island in ruins there's no way they can depict Enies Lobby as anything but a "complete defeat" for the World Government. The reunited Straw Hat Pirates leave the chaos of the Buster Call behind and sailed out of Enies Lobby. Sometime later, they see a Galley-La ship with  Iceburg and his shipwrights in it. However, their joy is short-lived as Merry's hull finally gave out and splits in two.

Luffy pleaded with Iceburg to fix the ship up one last time, but Iceburg cannot; he'd already done what he could. As he saw the ship laying on  Scrap Island (after having been dumped from Franky's lair by CP9), he too heard  the voice of the ship and decided to grant its request to sail once again; the ship was then carried off by the waves of  Aqua Laguna and sailed off on its own. He declared what he saw before him as a miracle: a ship so loved by its crew that it went beyond its limits to save them one last time; he praised ship and crew for such extraordinary loyalty. Luffy comes to realize what Iceburg is saying and understands what has to be done. After moving to Iceburg's ship, Luffy and the rest of his crew give Merry a viking funeral, setting her ablaze for her final voyage. As the crew lament the funeral of their ship, they each hear the soul of Merry, thanking them for taking good care of her. Though Luffy argued that her damage was their fault, Merry says that she was happy, with her only regret that she could not continue their voyage with them. As the ship starts to burn away, the crew mourn their friend, as Merry once more thanks them for a wonderful life.

### __Post-Enies Lobby Arc__

#### Familiar Faces, Family Legacy Revealed, and a Warning[]

After the  Straw Hats leave  Enies Lobby, the story shifts forward two days where the heroes have returned back to  Water 7.  Galley-La has begun fixing the damages to the city by the  Aqua Laguna, while the  Franky Family repairs their house.  Sodom and  Gomorrah have been patched up as well. While in  Iceburg's office, Iceburg and  Franky are shown having a conversation where Iceburg reveals that he plans to turn Water 7 into a ship and float it out to sea. Franky suddenly gets a call from  Zambai that the stuff he bought with the Straw Hats' stolen 200,000,000 has arrived.

The Straw Hats have finally awoken after two days of sleep save for  Luffy who is still sleeping while simultaneously eating at the same time.  Nami mopes over having lost their belongings in the storm, but Galley-La returns them after confiscating it while thinking that the Straw Hats were the assassins. Franky then comes by and reveals that he bought a legendary  Treasure Tree with their stolen 200,000,000 with which he plans to build a ship. He asks the Straw Hats to crew this ship, because his dream is that someone, he admires rides it.

Suddenly an outcry from the  shipwrights sound out as they realized a  Marine ship has docked at their port, recognizing it as the ship of the legendary  Vice Admiral  Garp, who cornered the  Pirate King,  Gol D. Roger. Garp tells two mysterious Marines to wait as he unceremoniously breaks down the wall to where the Straw Hats are staying and then punches the sleep-eating Luffy, waking him up. Surprisingly, it hurts the rubber man, and  Sanji comments that it should not. Garp claims there is no way to dodge a "fist of love" while removing his mask, commenting that Luffy has been too reckless. Luffy looks on in surprise as he identifies, much to everybody's shock, Garp as his grandfather.

Luffy tells the others to not lay a finger on him, as Garp may kill them. Luffy goes on to explain that he has nearly been killed many times by Garp in the past. Garp claims that the reason he shoved Luffy into deep valleys, left him into the jungle in the middle of the night, and many other dangerous methods, was all to make him a strong man. Garp then tells everyone that, in the end, he entrusted Luffy and  Ace to a friend of his to make them into strong Marines. Luffy yells at his grandfather that he always wanted to be a  pirate and Garp tells him that "the Red-Hair" influenced him with that nonsense. Luffy tells Garp that  Shanks saved his life, and a fight between the two breaks out. Suddenly, the two fall asleep. Garp, who wakes up first, punches Luffy and then ironically says that this kind of attitude is what makes people angry.

Garp then asks if Luffy knows what Shanks is doing right now. He then explains that there are four great pirates, the  Four Emperors, at the level of  Whitebeard, who rules the latter half of the  Grand Line and Shanks is one of them, along with Whitebeard. The only known power to stand against them are the  Marine Headquarters and the  Seven Warlords of the Sea.  Zoro then arrives and a fight between him and the marines occurs. Garp tells the two Marines he told to wait to try to stop him. Zoro fights against the Marine who wields the rare Kukri blades and Luffy fights against the Marine who uses  Soru. Luffy and Zoro effortlessly defeat them, and they reveal themselves to be  Koby and  Helmeppo. Luffy and Zoro are surprised on how Koby has grown so fast. Helmeppo starts getting angry at the two of them as they cannot recognize him. Garp then breaks up their little reunion as he repairs the wall he broke down while telling Luffy that he has met his father in  Loguetown. Luffy is clueless as he did not even know he had a father. Everyone is curious as to who Luffy's father may be. Garp then reveals Luffy's father to be  Monkey D. Dragon, the revolutionary, shocking everyone.

As the shock of Luffy's background settles, Garp states that his intention was not to arrest Luffy, as he was his grandson. The reason of his visit was to fulfill Koby and Helmeppo's wish to meet Luffy and his crew. After saying that, he leaves for his boat. Koby talks with Luffy, stating he did not pass through  Reverse Mountain for Marines boats are equipped with a  Seastone layer, thus being able to cross the  Calm Belts unnoticed. After some more conversation and fun, Koby prepares to leave. Before, though, he tells Luffy about the second half of Grand Line, the  New World.

He says that the one to conquer such a sea is to be the new "Pirate King" and invites Luffy to meet him there, when both their goals are accomplished: Luffy becoming Pirate King and Koby becoming a new Marine  Admiral. Sometime later, as the Straw Hats throw a BBQ Party with the Franky Family and Galley-La,  Aokiji and  Robin have a chat. Aokiji states that he originally intended to end Robin's drifting with her capture, but he himself was very surprised when the  CP9 was defeated. He then asks if Robin has found a place to stay, to which she answers with a sincere "yes".

Meanwhile, in "The New World", Marines report Red-Haired Shanks breaking through a Naval Blockade between himself and Whitebeard. As there is nothing else, they can do to prevent the reunion, they stand by. Shanks is about to meet Whitebeard and does some kind of big entrance, defeating the lower ranked ones of his crew with nothing more than his  Haki. As both of them begin their conversation, it is revealed that Shanks and  Buggy were in fact members of Gol D. Roger's  crew and had been in numerous battles with Whitebeard's crew. Whitebeard says just about everyone was astounded when he came back from East Blue without an arm, to which Shanks replies he had it bet in the "new era". Shanks tells Whitebeard the only scar he was still angry about was the one in his eye, made neither by  Hawk Eyes nor by any other enemy but the one and only  Blackbeard. They proceed to discuss the menace represented by that man. Shanks makes a shocking statement, asking Whitebeard to summon back Ace, in fear for his security. Whitebeard tells Shanks that he cannot do that, for Blackbeard's crime was killing one of his crew and that was unforgivable. They disagree and pull their swords. The two clash and the heavens split. The scene changes to the Grand Line, in an island where Blackbeard comments an article about Luffy's most recent adventure, pointing out they are nearby and preparing to leave to chase them. At that moment, Ace reaches Blackbeard and begins to talk.

#### New Bounties[]

Back on Water 7, the Straw Hats eagerly wait for their new ship, which would be done in five days.  Kokoro asks Nami whether she has already found the direction to the next island. Nami answers 'yes', but she says that the direction is pointing a little too downwards. Kokoro answers that the next island is  Fish-Man Island, located underwater. Sanji is very excited because of the number of young mermaids there (a dream that is crushed when he remembered that Kokoro is a mermaid; at this she angrily yells there are much younger mermaids). Robin is a bit worried about how  Devil Fruit users can get there but Kokoro says that getting undersea is not the problem, but even getting there is. Just between Water 7 and Fish-Man Island there is a  Florian Triangle, where hundreds of ships are crushed by the vicious terrain. The ships which do not sink are all empty, and many people speculate that the vacant ships are haunted. They were also wondering what bounties they will get, since the entire Enies Lobby's destruction is blamed on them (while mentioned nothing of Franky Family or  Buster Call), but they are all excitedâexcept Nami, who sees it as a bad thing, and Robin, who sees it neutrally. Five days later, as they go to receive their new ship, the Straw Hat Crew received their new bounties from a worrisome Franky Family:

"Straw Hat"  Monkey D. Luffy: 300,000,000

"Pirate Hunter"  Roronoa Zoro: 120,000,000

"Cat Burglar"  Nami: 16,000,000

"Demon Child"  Nico Robin: 80,000,000

"Cotton Candy Lover"  Chopper: 50

"Black Leg"  Sanji: 77,000,000

"King of Snipers"  Sogeking: 30,000,000

While Luffy and Zoro are happy, Nami is horrified to see she now has a  bounty, and Robin just smiled at her "small" rise (and updated poster photo). Chopper is shocked, due to his small bounty. Sanji is completely dejected, as the Marines failed to get his photograph and thus used a very ugly composite of him.

Ignoring the fact that the Straw Hats found this as good news, they revealed the last bounty poster:

"Cyborg"  Franky, with 44,000,000.

The Franky Family urges Luffy to take Franky, since he is now a wanted man and made a great asset to Luffy during Enies Lobby. They also reveal that he is a son of a pirate.

While everyone talks about their pictures and the Marines discuss what happened to Sanji's picture, they are presented with their new ship, a brigantine twice the size of Merry called the  Thousand Sunny, with many features like specially designed sails, a courtyard, and a locked fridge. Franky is also shown to have gone back to the  Franky House. He wants to stay on Water 7, but also wants to go with the Straw Hats. He knows he will say yes to Luffy if Luffy asks him to join, so he is hiding. However, the Franky Family wants him to join Luffy, and takes his swim briefs. This results in a half-naked Franky chasing them to get his underwear back. Franky is then caught by Zoro, Sanji, and Chopper, and put into a cannon. They fired him to a spot near to the Kings of All Beasts and Luffy is seen holding his underwear. He tells Franky if he wants his underwear back, he will have to join his crew.

Franky refuses at first and as a result Nico Robin uses her Devil Fruit power to grab and begin to crush his testicles, causing an uproar from both sides (Luffy, in particular, states that he wants Franky on his crew "as a man"). Franky uses this pain to hide the outpouring of emotion he feels as everyone tries and eventually succeeds in convincing him to go with the Straw Hats. Meanwhile, Zoro and Sanji rush to the scene stating that Garp is on the other side of the island. Despite the pain, he continues to refuse until Iceburg reminds him that his dream has not been fulfilled. His dream ship was built, yes, but his dream itself was to see his ship around the world and in many adventures. Franky finally relents, using his need for revenge on Nico Robin as an excuse (and the fact that none of them are able to properly repair a ship), and joins the Straw Hat Pirates. As he leaves, his family says goodbye, and he thanks  Tom for everything.

#### Usopp Returns and the Crew Departs[]

In one of Water 7's alleys,  Usopp hurriedly runs toward the new ship, stating that he had perfected his return to Straw Hats, believing that his crewmates will actually be cheering for his return. Franky, for that matter, is asking Luffy about his decision to set sail and Luffy gives him a valid reason, in a carefree tone that would be convincing if he wasn't sweating bullets. It is revealed that earlier on, the Straw Hats were talking about Usopp's practice. While Luffy was initially eager to pick him up, Zoro was against it, stating that Usopp should not be permitted to return as if nothing had happened, filled with pride after leaving of his own volition, and challenging Luffy to a fight. Thus, he threatened that Luffy must make Usopp realize he himself is too prideful and the guilty party here, or else he will be the one to leave this time.

After further discussion, they agreed to leave him on Water 7, unless Usopp gave a proper apology for his actions to the crew. On board of his ship, Garp was "complaining" that  Sengoku forced him to come back to deal with Luffy, while Aokiji took a nap on board of his ship. By then, the new ship set sail, and everyone believed Usopp was not coming back. Suddenly, Garp began to attack the Straw Hats by himself, and demonstrated his Iron Fist Meteorâin which he threw a very fast cannon ball by himselfâshocking everyone. It was at this point that Usopp would show up, who admitting that he himself had fought in Enies Lobby as Sogeking. He continued by talking about the great times that they had, but despite the fact that the Straw Hats are having trouble defending the , everyone (save Chopper) pretended they could not hear Usopp's words. Finally, Usopp realized they were serious about leaving without him, so he yells at the top of the lungs that he was sorry and with tears streaming out his eyes begs to rejoin their crew. Satisfied an overjoyed Luffy stretched his arm over and grabbed Usopp back onto the new ship.

With the Straw Hats once again whole, the group began to head out just as Garp's ship begins to bear down on them. Before doing so, they realize they must name their ship. Luffy stupidly suggests a few animal combinations with lion (due to the lion-shaped sternhead), but Franky makes a suggestion that Iceburg came up with; since Luffy wants to be the king of pirates then he and the Straw Hats should have a ship that should "sail thousands of oceans just like the sun" thus the name "Thousand Sunny". The crew instantly take a liking to it (despite Franky also having a name of his own) and thus the Thousand Sunny begins its maiden voyage as Garp prepares to crush the ship with a gigantic iron ball with his bare hands.

Luffy, however, tells Garp and Koby (though forgets Helmeppo again) that he will see them soon and gives one last thanks to the people of Water 7 before Franky activates the  (a cannon on the back of the ship) to catapult the ship into the air just as Garp launches the ball. Franky then states the Thousand Sunny will do everything the Going Merry can do and better and will pick up its torch for the Straw Hats' adventures as the ship escapes from the Marines.

Life soon starts to return to normal for Water 7,  Oimo and  Kashii decide to stay a little while, though comment on meeting "Sogeking" on  Elbaf. Galley-La returns to their shipyard. Kokoro,  Chimney and  Gonbe start to head back for their train station and Iceburg offers the Franky Family jobs at Galley-La prompting them to call him the "new bro". Meanwhile on an unnamed island,  Smoker has just caught another pirate when  Tashigi reminds him of the award ceremony for what happened in  Arabasta. Smoker comments that the Marines are restless and need a group even stronger than the Straw Hats to fight, though he wagers his pride that he will crush the Straw Hats in the New World.

Meanwhile, reports spread across the world about the Straw Hats raiding Enies Lobby in the  Baratie (where  Zeff and the cooks laugh at Sanji's ugly picture), in  Foosha Village (where the  mayor gripes about Luffy's notoriety),  Syrup Village (where  Kaya recognizes Usopp in spite of his Sogeking mask), in  Shimotsuki Village (where  Koushirou tells his students that he can't teach them how to be a pirate like Zoro),  Cocoyasi Village (where  Genzo both complains about and blows up Nami's wanted picture) and the  Drum Kingdom (now renamed Sakura Kingdom), with everybody noticing the Straw Hats' wanted posters. It then goes to Arabasta where King  Nefertari Cobra and his subordinates are just finding out about the Straw Hats new bounties as well as Nico Robin being in the crew. However, when  Vivi is told she takes the news in stride telling the others that there is no way to know what Luffy thinking, though is convinced that he will become Pirate King. Then the scene shifts to  Baltigo, a barren sort of island somewhere in the Grand Line. In a large, oddly shaped fort, some men are shown talking about the fall of  Centaurea. Another man nearby tells them not to be glad of a single victory; they are in the midst of war. He walks away, then notices Luffy's poster and asks about it. A man nearby tells him he was the one who took down  Crocodile, and after the events at Enies Lobby, the government could not suppress their existence any longer. The man walks out onto a balcony and is revealed to be Monkey D. Dragon. He encourages Luffy to follow his dreams, saying that the stability of the world must be questioned and that the time they meet will soon come. With that we go back to the crew who celebrates the return of Usopp and Robin as well their new crewmate and ship, Franky and the Thousand Sunny before setting out for their next destination, Fish-Man Island.

#### The Battle of Night and Day: Blackbeard vs. Fire Fist Ace[]

The scene then goes over to Blackbeard encountering Ace just as Blackbeard was preparing to head out after Luffy again upon reading the newspaper article regarding the Enies Lobby incident. While talking, it is revealed that Blackbeard murdered the  Whitebeard Pirates'  4th Division Commander Thatch, because he acquired the  Devil Fruit he had searched for during his time in Whitebeard's service. It is also revealed that Blackbeard joined the Whitebeard Pirates only to find the fruit. He then killed Thatch and ate it. The chapter ends with Blackbeard announcing to Ace that it is a  Logia fruit, but it is a very special type and that he is "Darkness."

A vicious battle ensues, and Ace uses a technique in which he makes a perpetual sun. Eventually Ace's hat is seen on the ground and the resolution of the duel is unknown but is stated to be the catalyst for a  greater conflict to come.

## Thriller Bark Saga

### __Thriller Bark Arc__

#### Arriving in the Devil's Sea: Luffy Meets a Talking Skeleton[]

A few days after their departure from  Water 7, the  Straw Hats enjoy the features of their new ship;  Usopp and  Luffy go fishing together and toss everything they catch into the aquarium, while  Robin,  Franky and  Sanji relax in the dining room,  Nami takes a bath in the bath hut,  Chopper enjoys his expanded room/infirmary and  Zoro takes a nap in the observation tower.

When Zoro wakes up, he notices a barrel floating in the ocean and alerts the rest of the crew over the built-in speaker system. When they fish the barrel out of the sea, they notice that it is an offering to the sea god. After a short discussion, they open the barrel, but instead of finding food and sake, a  red light shoots out of the barrel and into the sky. Fearing that someone may spot them and knowingÂ that a big storm is heading in their direction, Nami orders the crew to head southwest. Unfortunately, the headwind catches them, prompting Franky to unveil the  Soldier Dock Channel 0; a set of paddle wheels. Using the paddle wheels, they avoid the storm and finally enter the  Florian Triangle.

At first, Usopp thinks they might already have arrived at  Fish-Man Island, but he is quickly corrected by the others who explain to him (in a teasing manner) that they are in fact in the Florian Triangle (he did not know this, since he was not around when  Kokoro told the others about it). Upset that he was not notified about this and scared about the ghosts, he quickly grabs his exorcism set to rebuke any evil spirits. Suddenly, he and the rest of the crew hear an ominous song resounding throughout the fog and discover a ghost ship that has suddenly appeared behind them with a skeleton singing  Binks' Sake.

Excited and filled with overwhelming curiosity, Luffy starts to board the ship, with Nami and Sanji behind him, who want to stop him "in case he does something impulsive and stupid". When they arrive on board of the ship they are greeted by the self-proclaimed "Gentleman Skeleton"  Brook, whose first action is to question Nami as to whether or not he may see her panties. She, of course, denies this and knocks Brook to the floor.

Luffy, finding all this hilarious, asks Brook if the skeleton can poop, to which Brook replies yes only for Sanji to berate them both for their choice of questions. Opting for his own take on things, he then starts to shout questions at Brook about what happened to him and the ship, only to be interrupted by Luffy, who much to the shock of everybody else, asks Brook to join his crew. Brook casually agrees to, much to the horror of everyone else present. Leaving the ghost ship with them, Brook goes back with them to the ship and ends up having dinner with the crew. Brook is explaining his  Devil Fruit ability when Usopp (in Exorcist attire) notices that he has no shadow and no reflection.

Brook explains how his shadow was stolen, and sadly he cannot leave the foggy Florian Triangle with the Straw Hats for the sun would disintegrate him. Not wanting his new friends to get hurt, Brook refuses to reveal the culprit. Nonetheless, meeting the crew has brightened his dreary existence, and Brook is about to play the violin when a ghost appears. Just then, the gates of  Thriller Bark capture the  Thousand Sunny. Brook warns the Straw Hats to escape and runs across the water to Thriller Bark.

#### The Ghost Island of the Florian Triangle: Thriller Bark[]

After seeing Brook leave and the prospect of an adventure Luffy decides he wants to explore Thriller Bark. While the rest of the crew only want to escape their entrapment, Robin explains that they are confined within a large wall which encircles the entire island. Losing hope, both Nami and Chopper claim to have been stricken with Usopp's recurring, "Can't-get-on-this-island disease". Luffy then appears geared up to go, with a net and box ready to catch whatever he finds of interest. Despite Usopp's best efforts to dissuade the captain, Luffy is only further encouraged by the prospect of gaining Brook as a crew member, along with Robin and Franky deciding to join him as well.

Franky suggests they try out the Soldier Dock system while they decide what to do, claiming they'd need a smaller ship to make it to shore. Activating the mechanism, Franky reveals a Going Merry-themed paddle boat named  Mini Merry II. Usopp, Nami, and Chopper immediately jump in to try it out, making their way towards the shoreline. While Franky explains the Soldier Dock system in its entirety, the remaining crew are suddenly attacked by some invisible beast. After making fools out of Luffy, Franky, Sanji, and Zoro, it advanced upon Robin who attempted to resist using her  powers to hold it back yet was disturbingly licked by this invisible menace. The unseen enemy then flees as the ship begins to be pulled closer to the island.

Meanwhile, Nami, Usopp, and Chopper arrive on shore (crashing the Mini Merry II into a moat in the process) and try to figure out where they are. Finding themselves deep inside the waterless moat, out of the shadows a frightening three-headed stitched up dog suddenly appears. Identifying is as the mythical " Cerberus", the terrified trio escape with help from Usopp's , fleeing up a tree only to then encounter a strange vampire-like individual named  Hildon. He asks them if they would like to come to the mansion of  Dr. Hogback, whose name immediately gets Chopper's attention.

Chopper explains that Hogback is a famous doctor that went missing many years ago. By this time, they are in a carriage with Hildon listening to Chopper talk about Hogback. However, after seeing several frightening animals Nami and Usopp ask Hildon if he can ask the coach driver to take them back to the shore. After seeming to agree he goes outside to relay their request. Ten minutes pass and when the three look outside they find Hildon and the horses gone, leaving them alone inside of a graveyard. While they panic, Hildon, who was watching them from above, flies off towards the mansion. Meanwhile, without warning, out of the ground come hundreds of malformed zombies who immediately set their sights onto the terrified trio. A chaotic fight ensues with the three only getting away after Usopp uses his  attack to scare the zombies. However, with the undead still chasing them the three take off toward the mansion that Hildon told them was owned by Dr. Hogback.

Reaching the mansion's entrance, Nami, Usopp, and Chopper are confronted by a frightening stitched-up maid that starts hurling plates at Usopp until a man appears and orders her to stop, calling her  Cindry. Explaining that she once tested a lover's feelings by breaking all of his important dishes only to be kicked out, he then introduces himself to be the world famous, Dr. Hogback. Despite the ominous setting, Chopper is left in awe of Hogback and all three accept the invitation to dinner, where Hogback explains he is on the island to do research on the zombie inhabitants. Later, in the shower, Nami tells Usopp and Chopper she thinks Hogback is lying and knows more about the island than he lets on. Suddenly, Nami is attacked by the same invisible creature who attacked Robin, who then declares that he will take her as his bride. Getting her mouth free Nami shouts out to Usopp and Chopper. Bursting in and seeing the window opening on its own, Usopp lets off another  which destroys the bathroom wall.

Back at the Thousand Sunny, the remaining crew has been pulled to the shore and the ship caught in a giant web. Finding the Mini Merry II also caught but no sign of Nami, Usopp or Chopper, they are left pondering what to do. Deciding the only thing do is to explore the island through the nearby gate, they then disembark. Following the path inside the same boat from before, the remaining crew encounters the Cerberus from earlier. After Luffy "tames" it, the crew wanders through the forest encountering other strange creatures, Luffy trying to capture or convince each to join his crew. Meanwhile in the mansion, Nami, Usopp, and Chopper attempt to explore further, only to be attacked by several  zombies. Escaping, they then stumble upon a room decorated with pictures of Cindry. Nami discovers she was once a famous actress named Victoria Cindry, and she was reported to have died ten years ago from a falling accident. Finding a chest, they open it only to be terrified by a zombie Jack-in-the-Box. Taking off once again, this time they are pursued by even more zombies until they accidentally go through a secret passage in a fireplace that the zombies say leads to Hogback's lab.

Meanwhile, Luffy and the rest of the crew stumble across several intangible ghosts, similar to the one they encountered on the ship earlier which Luffy attempts to catch without success. The ghost is revealed to have the ability to induce a depressed state in people by passing through them, which Luffy, Franky, and Zoro quickly fall victim too. Luckily for them, however, the state is only temporary. Continuing towards the graveyard, they are attacked by the same zombie horde that chased Nami, Usopp, and Chopper, but defeats them with ease using a team combination move called, . After defeating the zombies, Luffy then asks if they saw anybody else pass through. Accidentally revealing that they'd attacked his lost crew members, Luffy and the others proceed to beat the zombies a second time. Leaving the graveyard, they encounter an  old man who, like Brook, is missing his shadow. The man then tells them a shadow thief is a man named  Gecko Moria. Hearing this name, Robin reveals that Gecko Moria is a  Warlord of the Sea with a  bounty that exceeds even Luffy's (who currently has a bounty of 300,000,000), stunning the rest of the crew.

Back in the mansion Nami, Usopp, and Chopper find Hogback's lab. Peeking inside, they watch as Hogback creates a zombie he calls  Mario. Suddenly, the mysterious figure from earlier appears and knocks them forward into the lab. Nami and Chopper exclaim it sounded like Brook but had flesh and skin. The person comes forward revealing himself to be a zombie samurai named  Ryuma, and when he sees Nami, he asks to see her panties. Initially angered by this, Nami realizes he is acting just like Brook. Ryuma responds by taking out his sword and then he runs right past them. Confused they try to run but are quickly taken down by his attack which they did not even realize had been done when he ran by them.

Outside, the clock strikes midnight. In the graveyard, the voice of the invisible man is heard ordering the defeated zombie soldiers to get up, which they do. The man starts to become visible revealing a tall man with a stitched lion's face. The zombies begin calling out his name,  Absalom, then calling him "Ero-salom" until he yells for them to shut up. Elsewhere, it shows a dozen of ghosts heading toward the tower behind Hogback's mansion. Entering this room with a teddy bear zombie welcoming them as they enter, a girl in the back of the room gets up telling the bear zombie to not talk because it is not cute. Meanwhile, in another part of the tower, three zombies enter the room where Gecko Moria is asleep to wake him up. From the top of the tower, lost in the fog, an enormous black sheet starts to come down. Luffy and his crew then learn from the old man that Thriller Bark is actually the world's largest pirate ship. With that, Luffy and his crew enter the mansion.

Soon, the zombie soldiers surround the place and Absalom enters the place to wake up the  Zombie Generals. These are revealed to be several large zombies, armored zombies, a drunk man called  John, and some other strange zombies.

As Absalom watches them leave to hunt the Straw Hats, he is confronted by a large zombie warthog bride named  Lola asking Absalom to marry her. Failing to force him to sign a marriage contract, Absalom tells Lola he plans to make Nami his bride. He even shows her Nami's wanted poster. Enraged, Lola vows to destroy Nami and runs off to do it. Absalom runs after her.

#### Captured Shadows: The Threat of Gecko Moria[]

Down in the mansion, Luffy and his crew are attacked by "Surprise Zombies" led by the taxidermized pig zombie  Buhichuck. The battle is short, and they notice Sanji has gone missing.

Meanwhile, in this strange forest, two zombie squirrels are transporting a coffin. Tripping, they drop the coffin Chopper is in, waking him up, and after driving off the squirrels, he wakes up Nami and Usopp. They quickly realize it is not an actual forest but  Perona's Wonder Garden which is located on a bridge spanning from Hogback's mansion the tower (which turns out is also the mast). More zombie animals show up including a dog-faced penguin zombie. However, when the other zombie's attack Nami, the dog penguin rushes to her defense. When the other zombies demand to know what he is doing, the dog-penguin declares he will not ever harm a lady.

Lola suddenly shows up and attempts to attack Nami. However, Nami is lifted off her feet and it is revealed to be Absalom. Nami takes her  Clima-Tact and uses  to electrocute Absalom, then she and the others take off pursued by Lola. Absalom mistakes the shock for love and orders the zombie animals to help him. After some rude remarks, he threatens the zombies to mind who they talk to. Absalom is then confronted by the dog penguin, but he blasts the dog with some sort of invisible attack. In the mansion, it is revealed that Zoro has gone missing too.

Luffy finds a suit of armor and puts it on. Coming into a huge room full of tents, he, Franky, and Robin are ambushed by a Zombie General. Franky proceeds to pound it, but the armored knight keeps getting up. Many more Zombie Generals appear. Buhichuck runs off, sealing the way they came from. A vicious battle ensues as Luffy, Robin, and Franky tries to get out. Franky discovers these zombies fend off their weakness to fire with buckets of water. Luffy suddenly sees a Zombie General named  Jigoro use Zoro's  technique. Franky and Robin manage to finally escape onto a stone bridge spanning from the mansion to the tower beneath Perona's Wonder Garden. However, they discover Luffy has been taken captive by the zombies and is being transported by a chain to the tower. As they run after him, they are blocked by a giant spider/monkey hybrid Zombie General called  Tararan.

Back on the Thousand Sunny, Perona and other zombies are scavenging the ship for treasure when Hildon shows up and informs her that Luffy has been captured and their master is planning to bring out Zombie 900. In Perona's Wonder Garden, Nami is cornered by Lola. Keeping her wits, Nami convinces Lola she is really a man.

Having stopped Lola, Nami proceeds to talk to Lola telling her she has to go after Absalom if she wants him to marry her. Taking this advice, Lola goes after Absalom who is next seen in Perona's room with  Kumashi when Perona shows up. Then, it is revealed that while Lola went after Absalom, Nami and the others ran away and are hiding in Kumashi.

Back on the bridge, Robin and Franky are cornered by the generals. Thinking quickly; Franky smashes the bridge. However, as they fall; Robin reveals the ability to fly for five seconds by using her powers to form large wings. While she keeps them airborne, Franky launches his Â to grab the ledge. However, Tararan is on the tower side of the gap. Suddenly, a weird noise is heard and Brook plummets out of the sky and into the courtyard with the Zombie General.

Tararan begins spinning his web out of his hand moving toward them. Robin uses her  Devil Fruit powers to slap Tararan in the eyes when he brings his hands to his eyes, he gets the web in them. Next, Franky takes his iron nunchucks and combines them with some stone columns and starts bashing Tararan hard. However, just when it seemed they would win, Robin is attacked by several Spider Mice zombies. As Franky turns to help her, he is caught by Tararan's web. Just then, Brook appears having leaped up from the courtyard.

After a brief conversation with Robin and Franky, Tararan suddenly gasps in pain. It is revealed just like Ryuma, Brook attacked Tararan without him realizing it for a short period of time. Suddenly, something comes out of Tararan's mouth and Tararan lies defeated. Horrified by the defeat of their leader, the Spider Mice flee. After freeing himself and Robin, Franky asks Brook what is going on. Brook tells them after Hogback gathers bodies, he fixes them up, but to bring them to the life he needs Moria's help. Moria steals shadows and puts them in corpses creating his zombie army. Moria is able to do this because he has the power of the  Kage Kage no Mi. And the stronger the person whose shadow is stolen, the stronger the zombie warrior becomes. The zombies also gain the personality and combat styles of the person whose shadow they come from.

However, the zombies do have a weakness: salt. Because their power is Devil Fruit-based, salt from the ocean frees the shadow to go back to its owner. It flashes back to the front of the mansion where hundreds of zombie soldiers lie lifeless having been purified by Brook. Also, Moria cannot kill the person he steals shadows from for it would kill the zombie. Brook gives the two a bag of salt and runs off.

Perona, Kumashi, Absalom, and Dr. Hogback with Cindry arrive in a massive room and sitting on the throne is Gecko Moria. Moria reveals his desire to be Pirate King. Luffy, who is tied up in a cage, yells he will be Pirate King. Moria and his chief officers converse on their aims when the three soldiers guarding him yelled out, "Luffy ate the steel cage and is escaping." Perona lets loose a few ghosts who subdue him with their negative attack. With that, Gecko Moria begins to remove Luffy's shadow while Nami, Usopp, and Chopper watch in horror from Kumashi. With his shadow removed, Luffy loses consciousness. Moria mentions how he was once defeated by a person called  Kaidou in the  New World. Moria orders the Spider Mice to take Luffy back to his ship. Before they leave, the Spider Mice inform him of Tararan's defeat.

The Spider Mice trap Luffy and rush off down the stairs taking him to the Thousand Sunny. Absalom is concerned about Brook, but Perona does not know about him. Moria, not bothered by this development, orders his three personal zombies to open the door to the freezer where Zombie 900 is stored. Elsewhere, Franky and Robin hurry back to the Thousand Sunny, looking for the others on the way. Meanwhile, Brook confronts Ryuma in Hogback's Lab.

#### Brook's Surprising Connection; Retrieve the Shadows before Sunrise![]

In the tunnel of the freezer, all the leaders of Thriller Bark are excited about their plans for the future. They enter the chamber, where this enormous giant twenty times Moria's size rests. Moria declares it was once the great conqueror known as  Oars. Moria walks on one of the chains supporting Oars and inserts Luffy's shadow. The monster awakens and roars for food. Nami, Usopp, and Chopper fall out of Kumashi and are discovered. However, Oars roars out for food again and they run off. They head down the stairs when suddenly Usopp and Chopper are enveloped in explosions. Absalom grabs Nami and turns himself and her invisible and escapes. Usopp and Chopper are set upon by dozens of soldier zombies. However, just as they are being overwhelmed, Franky and Robin show up and begin purifying zombies.

Moria has his zombies bring Oars tons of food to eat. The zombies watch in shock as Oars consumes vast amounts of Thriller Bark's stored foods and still wants more. Moria tells Oars who he is and that he is now his minion, but Oars declares he will be Pirate King and proceeds to break out of the freezer much to the astonishment of the zombies. Meanwhile, Robin, Franky, Usopp, and Chopper run downstairs that lead to the ships. In Hogback's lab, Ryuma reminds Brook of what happened last time he was in Thriller Bark. They begin to fight. Elsewhere, Absalom prepares to force Nami to marry him. The remaining Straw Hats reach their ship which has been ransacked by the Zombies and find Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro. After several blows on the head by Franky, to no effect, Usopp lies that "A beautiful lady swordsman just arrived with a ton of meat!!" they begin to come to.

After their current situation is explained to the now awakened Straw Hats, it is revealed by Franky that Brook was a member of the crew that promised  Laboon fifty years ago that they would return to  Reverse Mountain. Meanwhile, Brook is fighting with Ryuma while thinking how every time he thinks about Laboon, his heart squeezes in pain even though he does not have a heart, and that how Laboon will not recognize him without his afro. With the situation revealed, Luffy is now more determined than ever to make Brook join his crew.

They begin to plan their counterattack, with Luffy stating that it would be easier to just go and beat Moria than to look for their individual shadows, leaves Nami up to Sanji (burning with rage over the idea of a wedding) and Usopp, Franky decides to go help Brook with Zoro joining him. Before setting out, Usopp gives everyone a bag of salt and says that they should definitely finish their objectives before dawn, or they will be at a disadvantage. Meanwhile, Oars has climbed to the top of the main mast of Thriller Bark, amazed that it is a ship, and declares that he will become Pirate King with it while Hildon reports to Moria that the Straw Hats have woken up and are rampaging about destroying zombies and that Absalom's wedding has started with all the Zombie Generals attending. Perona says she will take care of them and Hogback requests to be made second in command. Luffy, Sanji, Usopp, Robin, and Chopper are taking the upper bridge to where Moria is when Luffy and Sanji get hit with the negative ghosts. Oars comes crashing down destroying the bridge and taking Sanji and Usopp down with him to the lower bridge where Zoro and Franky are, where they attacked what they thought was a wall but is actually Oars.

Luffy, Robin, and Chopper continue to where Moria is when they encounter Dr. Hogback along the way. Chopper says he will fight Hogback and that Luffy should go on ahead, Robin stays behind as well to deal with Cindry. Chopper tells Hogback that he no longer recognizes him as a doctor. Luffy finds Moria, who treats him with indifference. Back at the bridge, Oars gets up causing Sanji, Zoro, Franky, and Usopp to panic over his sheer size, but Oars does not even notice them. He makes a hat out of part of the mansion then walks away saying he will be Pirate King. After voicing their concerns over the destroyed bridge, they realize Franky has already built a new one and are all shocked by the speed and quality Franky put into it. They then encounter Perona in her room where she reveals she has the powers of the  Horo Horo no Mi and are all hit with her negative spirits and fall to the ground. Perona then orders her zombies to capture them but are destroyed by Usopp's . Perona sends more ghosts through him, but they have no effect as Usopp states he is already negative, thoroughly shocking Perona. Usopp tells the others to get up and says he will deal with her. Meanwhile, the wedding has progressed, and Absalom is about to kiss a still unconscious Nami.

#### Countdown to Sunrise: Battling the Mysterious Four[]

Perona sends four more of her ghosts through Usopp causing the ghosts and Perona to become depressed. Meanwhile, Sanji flies off (literally) to save Nami. The fight between Brook and Ryuma continues with Ryuma wondering what he should cut off next with his special arrow notch slash. Brook reveals that the technique came from a kingdom's assault squad and its real name is  Requiem Handoul, nicknamed by his old crew, and he does not want Ryuma using that name. They face off one last time, seemingly walking past each other, using their fastest sword techniques and Brook is defeated. Just as Ryuma is about to cut off Brook's afro, all of Thriller Bark starts shaking causing both of them to fall over. Just as Zoro and Franky arrive, Ryuma charges and is blocked by Zoro who says Ryuma has a nice sword. Ryuma states that it is one of the  21 O Wazamono Grade Swords,  Shusui, and Zoro says that he will use that blade. Back at the wedding, the shaking has caused Absalom to miss kissing Nami and it is revealed that a strange ocean current is causing it thanks to Oars moving the rudder. Absalom orders all Zombie Generals to stop Oars who pummels them with his , Sanji finally arrives at the wedding.

Luffy demands that Moria returns everybodyâs shadows and that he will kick Moria's ass, prompting Moria to ask how exactly Luffy will do that and even if Luffy beats him up or even kills him the shadows will not return unless he orders them to do so. Luffy rears up for a  only to have it blocked by Moria's shadow, his duplicate  Doppelman. Moria then tells Luffy that in the past he was too overconfident in his own ability and ambition and learned the importance of having strong subordinates so their power can make him Pirate King without himself having to lift a finger. Luffy retorts that he will be the Pirate King and Moria reveals that a shadowâs master can sometimes leave a very strong will behind, but itâs still just a matter of time until that will fade, and they become another obedient zombie. Moria's shadow turns into several black bats to block Luffy's attacks and then starts to bite him making Moria ask how this is "kicking my ass?". Luffy jumps down into the freezer causing Moria to think Luffy is trying to escape only for Luffy to launch a  through the ledge Moria is sitting on literally kicking his butt behind.

Sanji kicks the zombie holding Nami away and for a moment thinks he rescued a goddess instead. Absalom demands that Sanji returns his bride and mistakes Nami for an angel. Sanji finds this totally understandable because of Nami's pure white dress. Absalom then fires an explosion at Sanji, who dodges it and berates Absalom for nearly hitting Nami. Absalom then figures out that the animal zombie that attacked him earlier must have had Sanji's shadow, as Sanji is mistaking Nami as a holy nymph, and that he does not have time to deal with small fry only to be kicked in the face, sending Absalom's 300-kilogram body flying. Absalom tries to use his  (the explosion technique, which is actually a pair of guns strapped to his hands turned invisible by his power) only for Sanji to redirect it. He then proceeds to kick the hell out of Absalom who tries to escape by turning invisible. Sanji uses Usopp's salt balls to find him and continue kicking him, literally exploding with anger, states that there is one last problem between them.

Sanji reveals he knows the source of Absalom's power, the  Suke Suke no Mi. Sanji goes on to add that he had always been on the lookout for the fruit desiring the power to make himself invisible, saying that he would use it to help humans, but he only wants to spy on nude girls. It revealed that Absalom's body has been upgraded by Hogback with gorilla and bear muscle, elephant skin, and his lion jaws. Despite this, Sanji slams Absalom against a wall. Meanwhile, Usopp fights Perona, who at the beginning runs away, only to threaten Usopp with previously unrevealed powers, like flying or sending exploding mini ghosts on Usopp. Though Usopp tries, he cannot seem to harm her, as all attacks go right through her. He is beaten heavily by Kumashi so that he asks " Sogeking" for "help". "Sogeking" then purifies Kumashi and demands Usopp to fight on, till, at the end of his wits, Usopp discovers the reason of Perona's invulnerability-she is a host projection, while her real body is in her room.

Usopp fires a shot at the real Perona but misses and Perona then launches an attack with a gigantic exploding ghost and then goes back into her body. Usopp stores the explosion in his impact dial and Perona find herself unable to move, as she is glued to the wall, due to Usopp's "dud" shot. A mustached hippo attacks Usopp, whom he hits with the stored impact. Usopp then shoots his "", a bunch of cockroaches (that are actually fake), at her and then hits her with his  that is actually a balloon on an inflatable stick. She collapses from the shock, as Usopp leaves her behind.

At another point, Zoro fights Ryuma, who proves to be a formidable enemy whose main technique is to destroy one of Zoro's swords in combat. The battle progresses and Brook says that the two are nearly equal in strength. Finally, Zoro manages to wound him, and the wound catches fire. Ryuma is then defeated. He then gives Zoro his sword, saying that it shall be "happy with him" and that he feels ashamed that he has "made this samurai's body suffer defeat". A few seconds later, his shadow returns to Brook.

Meanwhile, Robin and Chopper are fighting Hogback, but are restrained by Jigoro and  Inuppe, until the two (bearing Zoro's and Sanji's shadow and their personality traits) begin to fight when Hogback orders them to kill anyone who gets in their way. Robin then holds Hogback's mouth shut, tricking him into "order them to jump off the building". Hogback, angered after the crushing, does indeed shout it out in anger, making the two zombies jump off instead. Chopper talks about how Hogback has failed as a doctor, to which Hogback replies that he was a doctor only because of the wealth. He explains how he proposed to Cindry in her lifetime, but she refused him because she was already engaged, and later on she died.

He was then approached by Gecko Moria who asks for him to join his crew, accepting, on the condition that he can bring Cindry back, with a different person's shadow. He then demonstrated Cindry's obedience when given a direct order, by kicking her down and forcing her to lick the floor with her tongue. He then states he only cared about the body and not about the soul of the woman that rejected him. He then sends Cindry to beat Chopper. Chopper, however, does not fight her, saying, what would her family think if they knew about this. Hogback orders her to spare him some time, as he is escaping, but Cindry starts crying, saying that her body cannot move.

She regains her posture somewhat, and charges forth again, but is held back by Robin, while Chopper goes forth for Hogback. Then, using a combined attack with Robin, using a foot sprouting technique, they ascend to a great height, from which Chopper wishes to drop off Hogback for all the evil he has done. Meanwhile, Oars, who was summoned to Moria and has now become obedient, is sent off by Moria to wreak havoc across Thriller Bark and capture all the Straw Hats, beat them and put them on their ship, just before he smilingly runs away from Luffy. Oars does indeed rampage and interrupts Chopper's and Robin's attack. Hogback falls down but is engulfed within rocks. He orders Cindry to free him, yelling that her only positive feature is her face, being afraid that Oars, who is coming closer, will crush him. However, Cindry just turns to him, smiling for the first time, like she did when she was alive, afterwards we are left to believe Hogback was stepped on by Oars.

#### The Colossal Threat: Straw Hat Pirates vs. Oars[]

In a different place, Oars chases Usopp and Sanji respectively, while this interruption makes it possible for Absalom to once again steal Nami away from Sanji. The crew is reunited, just as Oars is standing in the courtyard, yelling at the Straw Hats to come out, to which Franky replies that they have to take him down together. Luffy continues to chase Moria while the rest of the crew, minus Nami, faces off against Oars, who identifies them by their bounty posters on his arm. Each of the Straw Hats tries attacking Oars individually, but to no avail, and no small amount of salt can purify him as he pummels the crew.

Meanwhile, Perona wakes up wondering who could have caused so much destruction, only for Oars' arm to smash through the wall near her while looking for the girl (Nami). Perona panics and decides to leave Thriller Bark with the Thousand Sunny.

Back at the wedding ceremony, Nami has woken up, about to be kissed by Absalom only to be attacked by an enraged Lola, which was a ruse to try and help Nami escape. Absalom attacks Lola prompting Nami to attack Absalom with her Clima-Tact's  knocking him out thanks to all the damage he took from Sanji and leaving Lola to marry the unconscious Absalom.

Meanwhile, the rest of the crew gets back up for another round with Oars. Zoro decides they should send Oars flying and Franky decides to use  which is essentially Franky standing on Zoro and Sanji's shoulders holding Usopp in his right hand with Chopper on top of his head, Robin does not participate because it was too embarrassing. This upsets Oars (he was getting pumped for it) who sends Franky, Usopp, and Chopper flying all the while feeling betrayed by Robin who flatly tells them never to do that again. After a lot of teamwork and combo attacks, the crew manages to flip Oars over on his head.

Nami finally reaches the treasure room only to find it has already been cleaned out by Perona. Back at the Thousand Sunny, Perona's zombies have restocked the food supply and almost loaded all the treasure on board when out of nowhere,  Bartholomew Kuma of the Seven Warlords of the Sea shows up asking where Moria is. Nami has found out what Perona is planning and races off to Thousand Sunny. Meanwhile, Oars finds that his horns are stuck in the ground allowing the crew to get some free shots thoroughly engaging Oars. Once Oars gets free, they proceed to break his knees, while Nami has caught up with Perona. Before the two begin to fight, Kuma appears again whom Perona identifies as "The Tyrant", stating that he was brutal beyond all measure while he was still a pirate. Kuma asks if Perona works for Moria, which she denies and says she was just leaving, Kuma asks her where she would like to go to which she answers a creepy old castle and then tries to attack Kuma, who makes her disappear, literally. He then asks Nami if it's true that Luffy has a brother, to which she replies yes. Back in the forest, Luffy thinks he has finally caught up with Moria but it's just his shadow and dawn is now approaching.

The fight with Oars continues with Zoro using his , which is now much more powerful with his new blade, remarking that that Shusui has a bit of a temper. Oars dodges it. The two pirate crews resolve to get Luffy his shadow back before dawn so he can still fight even if they run out of time. Thriller Bark starts shaking again and the fog clears. Thanks to Oars messing with the rudder, Thriller Bark has drifted out of the Florian Triangle. Meanwhile, Kuma has finally found Moria who tells him that the successor to  Crocodile has been chosen:  Marshall D. Teach, also known as Blackbeard with a former bounty of zero. Moria takes this with apathy until Kuma tells him the government is afraid of another Warlord being defeated by the Straw Hats.

This angers Moria who tells Kuma to sit back and watch as he defeats the Straw Hats. Back at the battle with Oars, the crew is still shocked over the mist dissipating when Moria reveals that he is inside of a control room in Oars' stomach. Moria then challenges them saying that if they can defeat him, he will return all their shadows. Zoro tells Usopp to go find a mountain of salt so they can purify Oars only for Moria to destroy the way to the kitchen. Luckily, Usopp was saved by Brook who already went and got the salt. Brook reveals that he drank some milk in the kitchen, and it revived him completely. Moria continues to take this with indifference while Brook asks to fight alongside the crew. After some more combo attacks, Franky tries to hit Moria point blank only to get knocked out. As Oars is about to finish him Nami arrives using her  so they can get Franky to safety. Oars uses  at Nami. Robin saves Nami from the attack and Luffy is still lost in the forest, where he meets some of Moria's other victims who say they can give him the power he needs to defeat Moria.

They take Luffy to their captain  "Proposal" Lola, who has been rejected 4,443 times, who immediately proposes to Luffy who rejects her making it 4,444 times. They inform Luffy that Moria is now inside Oars' stomach and the only way Luffy can beat Moria is to beat Oars first. They proceed to place a shadow into Luffy stating that once purified, they are easy to capture and ask Luffy if he is good with a sword, Luffy says he is not while demonstrating amazing swordsmanship. It is explained that if a shadow is placed in a body that has its own soul it will augment their power with the shadow's skill but will only last about ten minutes before the shadow goes back to its owner. They proceed to place 100 shadows in Luffy and dubbing him "Nightmare Luffy". The crew and Oars continue to fight with Oars gaining the upper hand thanks to his new-found stretching ability. Moria tells them that he has reversed the role of the shadow obeying the body henceforth he can now alter Oars' shape at will by changing the shape of Oars' shadow.

Brook, Nami, Usopp, and Robin launch a new combo and throw Oars off balance and giving Zoro a chance to land a damaging blow. Oars takes out Brook with a  and then targets Usopp, but he stops stretching thanks to Robin putting Moria in a choke hold with her powers. Shortly after this, Moria uses his powers to steal Robin's shadow through Oars, making her pass out instantly and loose her grip. Enraged by this, Sanji activates his , just in time to deflect a  aimed at the defenseless Robin. As Chopper discovers Oars' cause of death (freezing to death in the snow due to lack of clothes) and his weak point, Sanji and Chopper launch a combo attack on Oars' right arm and are then knocked out by Oars'  attack leaving only three of the eight fighting them standing.

Zoro creates an opening for Usopp to launch the salt into Oars' mouth but gets knocked out in the process, but instead of Luffy's shadow coming out Moria's does and throws the salt back at Usopp. Moria orders Oars to stomp Nami and Usopp but Luffy arrives in time to save them. Oars uses his  on Luffy who stops it with one hand and proceeds to send Oars flying into Thriller Bark's forest. The  Rolling Pirates arrive and tend to the wounded Straw Hats while Nightmare Luffy unleashes a barrage of attacks against Oars and Moria, at one point slashing through Oars with a sword, hitting Moria in the face with a , and seemingly finishing them off with . All the shadows then leave Luffy, and he goes unconscious as the victims of Moria cheer that Thriller Bark has fallen.

However, shortly afterward, Oars gets back on his feet and the sun is almost up. The rest of the Straw Hats and Brook make it to their feet to end the fight with Oars. Usopp and Franky make a freezing wind cannon to turn the water from Nami's  to ice to keep Oars from moving his legs, Robin uses her powers to create legs for Brook to jump on while carrying Luffy to the top of Thriller Bark's main mast while Sanji uses a huge chain to keep Oars in place and Zoro using his Â technique to straighten Oars' back. Chopper explains that the human spine is S-shaped so it can absorb shocks and straightening it will cause Oars to take much more damage. Luffy descends activating  and hitting Oars directly in the face with his  shattering Oars' spine.

#### The Nightmare Never Ends: Shadow's Asgard and Tyrant Kuma[]

However, their victory is short-lived as Moria arises from Oars' cockpit. After giving the Straw Hats a speech about how the New World is out of their league, he uses his ultimate technique: . By absorbing all of his zombie's shadows (including Cindry, Inuppe, Captain John, Lola, Jigoro, Hildon, Buhichuck,  Gyoro, Nin, and Bao, and Oars), he transforms into a giant, deformed version of himself, resembling a lizard or a gecko. As he displays his newfound, destructive power, the pirates realize that they have one more problem at their hands, the sun is rising. As the Rolling Pirates (minus Lola) run for cover so they do not burn away, Luffy activates  in order to combat, and defeat Moria's new form.

Luffy begins to repeatedly strike at Moria's stomach, causing the latter to lose control of the shadows and release a small number of them. Trying to hold the remaining shadows in, he manages to trap Luffy within a black box made of shadows before crushing it. Emerging from wreckage, Luffy uses all his strength to combine  and , launching his enlarged body into Moria with the strengths of both forms. The impact of this move causes Thriller Bark's mast to fall on top of Moria, forcing him to spew out all the shadows just as the sun comes out and the Straw Hats start burning away.

At the last second the shadows return to the crew, and they are saved. The Rolling Pirates and the Straw Hats celebrate, Absalom is woken up by Dr. Hogback and plan to escape. Other people around the world celebrate as their shadows are returned too.

The celebration is cut short when Kuma appears and is ordered by the  World Government to revive Moria and eliminate everyone who witnessed his defeat. Kuma takes out a few of the Rolling Pirates by launching paw-shaped air blasts similar to . He then teleports again and appears in front of the Straw hats and claims he will start with Zoro.

Zoro begins the battle, but Kuma is able to dodge or deflect all of Zoro's attacks with the use of his Devil Fruit ability, the  Nikyu Nikyu no Mi. Franky underestimates Kuma's ability and is taken out by one hit from Kuma. Sanji and Usopp enter the fray in order to save Zoro, but their attacks do not faze Kuma at all.

Kuma uses his Devil Fruit to compress the air into a paw-shaped balloon, making a small but powerful bomb. Kuma replies that he can let them live if they surrender Luffy to the World Government.

The Straw Hats and Rolling Pirates simultaneously shout "NEVER!", and Kuma merely replies, "What a pity" and launches the bomb. The blast destroys most of Thriller Bark, though this does not succeed in killing the Straw Hats but knocks out all of them except Zoro. Zoro surprise attacks Kuma, slicing into his shoulder, exposing his  Pacifista modifications. This attack only proves to irritate the Warlord of the Sea and he easily defeats Zoro. Knowing death was upon him, Zoro offers to trade his life for Luffy's. Then, Sanji appears and asks Kuma to take his life instead of Zoro's. Hearing this, Zoro knocks out Sanji unconscious. Kuma agrees to Zoro's offer and uses his Devil Fruit to project Luffy's pain onto Zoro. Kuma then teleports to the entrance to the ship, musing about how  Dragon has raised a good son with a fine crew.

When everyone comes to, Luffy is perfectly fine, but Zoro is nowhere to be seen. Sanji finds Zoro standing alone outside the ruins. He is still alive, but his blood is splattered in a wide radius around him. Zoro shortly states that nothing happened.

#### A Promise to Return: Bidding Farewell with a Song[]

Hogback, Absalom, and Moria make their escape from Thriller Bark and read in the  newspaper that  Ace is now imprisoned in  Impel Down. A day has passed and everyone except Zoro is up and celebrating with a feast in the courtyard. Sanji prevents any of the witnesses from informing anyone of what Zoro did (Robin eavesdrops on the conversation). Brook finds a piano and plays some background music, a song that all the pirates of old know: " Binks' Sake", which both Luffy and Robin have heard before. Luffy tells Brook of how he met Laboon at Reverse Mountain which causes Brook to break down in tears. Now that he knows Laboon is still waiting for him, Brook remembers the first time he and the  Rumbar Pirates met Laboon.

In the  West Blue, more than fifty years ago, the Rumbar Pirates encountered a baby whale who had strayed from his pod and decided to sing a song to cheer him up. Not long after, all the Rumbar Pirates grew fond of him and named him Laboon. When they were approaching the  Grand Line, they knew that it was too dangerous for Laboon to come, so they ignored him, hoping he would leave and try to find his pod. After coming down from Reverse Mountain, they discovered that Laboon had followed them. Three months later, they leave Laboon at  Twin Capes and promise to return. Three years have passed now and the Captain of the Rumbar Pirates,  "Calico" Yorki, and some of the crew have fallen ill with a virus their doctor cannot cure. Filled with regret, he asks Brook to keep their promise to Laboon for them as he and the other infected members meet their deaths trying to escape through the  Calm Belt.

Back in the present, Brook takes a  Tone Dial out of his skull that contains the final song the Rumbar Pirates performed before they died. As the song plays, the Straw Hats and Rolling Pirates join in, and Brook remembers how the rest of the Rumbar Pirates fought against enemy pirates that use poisoned weapons. He also remembers how they went from a band, to a quartet, a trio, a duet, and finally a solo as Brook finally died remembering Laboon.

In the present, Brook still has the pride of a pirate and resolves to meet Laboon from the "front" as promised. Brook decides to seal the Tone Dial away inside his skull and joins Luffy's crew. At Reverse Mountain, Laboon is shown in good spirits as he lets out a terrific roar. Brook shows the others his wanted poster as he is known as "Humming Brook" with a bounty of 33,000,000 and pledges his life to Luffy.

Two days have passed and Usopp and Franky have erected a grave in the cemetery for Brook's crew. Zoro is awake, and joins Brook at the grave, burying  Yubashiri there and finally getting formally acquainted with the crew's new musician. As the Straw Hats are getting ready to leave, Lola gives Nami half of a piece of paper calling it her mother's " Vivre Card" which will always point in the direction of its owner and how they should find Lola's  mother in the New World if they ever get in to trouble.

Luffy remembers the piece of paper Ace gave him back at  Arabasta and finds that it is getting smaller and is burning, Lola explains that this means Ace's life is in danger. Though Luffy is concerned, he decides to not pursue his brother, believing that Ace can handle himself and that the next time they meet, they will be rival pirates.

With everything needed to continue on their journey, the Straw Hat Pirates finally leave Thriller Bark and Florian Triangle, following the  Log Pose towards Fish-Man Island. However, as the Rolling Pirates attempt to leave via Brook's ship, Lola almost thinks she sees something in the fog as they attempt to escape the triangle. Although she passes it off, a pair of huge eyes stare at the opposite crew.

## Summit War Saga

### __Sabaody Archipelago Arc__

#### The Halfway Mark and the Mermaid[]

In  Mary Geoise,  Fleet Admiral  Sengoku chastises  Bartholomew Kuma for not going after the  Straw Hats like originally planned, while  Vice Admiral  Monkey D. Garp tells the leader of the  Marines about how  Luffy was able to get away from yet another government foe. Even so, Garp assures Sengoku that Luffy is not one who will go and spread the fact of  Gecko Moria's defeat to others.

A few days after departing from the  Florian Triangle and the ghost ship  Thriller Bark, the Straw Hats continued to follow the  Log Pose in the direction it had been pointing since it last set on  Water 7. After making their way through bizarre weather and fighting massive  Sea Kings, they finally arrive directly above the location indicated by the pose,  Fish-Man Island. However, instead of finding the long-sought after destination, the Straw Hats encounter another obstacle: the  Red Line, the continent that encircles the Prime Meridian of the world. Having originally entered the  Grand Line at  Reverse Mountain on the other side of the Red Line, this means that the crew have traveled half-way around the Grand Line. With the continent blocking access into the  New World, and therefore to both Luffy's dream of becoming Pirate King and new crewmate  Brook's dream of getting back to Reverse Mountain and reuniting with  Laboon.

Therefore, the presence of the Red Line poses many problems to the Straw Hats. For one thing, the extremely tall Red Line looks impassable, preventing passage into the New World. Also, their exact location is close to many of the crucial government landmarks, including the holy land of Mary GeoiseÂ and  Marine Headquarters. With the Log Pose continuing to point downwards, Luffy,  Robin and Brook decide to use the ship's  Shark Submerge to search for any signs of Fish-Man Island, only to find nothing after reaching the limit of 5,000 meters except an angry rabbit Sea King.

Chased to the surface by the creature, Luffy defeats it easily with his , which made it spit out a small  mermaid (who lands right on a super-excited  Sanji) and a starfish. The mermaid, revealed to be named  Camie, introduced herself by trying to sell the crew some  takoyaki. Camie, after having introduced herself and her talking starfish,  Pappag, calls  Hatchan, but is shocked when someone else answers his  Den Den Mushi. The  Macro Pirates have caught Hatchan, intending to sell him into slavery. Camie wishes to save him and Luffy agrees to do so, after consulting with  Nami.

Camie uses her ability to be able to speak with fish and navigates the ship towards Grove 44 of the  Sabaody Archipelago, having been told that Hatchan is being held at the base of the  Flying Fish Riders, which lies on this route. Before they arrive, they are attacked by the Flying Fish Riders, who after a brief battle return to their base to report back to their leader,  Duval, an extremely tall man in an iron mask.

After hearing that the ship has been identified as belonging to the Straw Hat Pirates, the mysterious man states his intention to kill "the man who destroyed my life". Meanwhile, the Straw Hats approach the base, attempting to figure out ways to defeat the flying fish, although Luffy really just wants to ride one. Camie is worried about Hatchan, although Pappag assures her that he will be safe.

#### Flying Fish Riders and the Man in the Iron Mask[]

The Macro Pirates attempt to ask Duval why he made them retreat, and he replies by shooting harpoons at them whilst ranting about the man who ruined his life, striking fear into his own crew as well as the  Fish-Men.  Macro himself tries to apologize to Duval for the stupidity of his own crew, but Duval congratulates them for revealing the Straw Hats to him. Meanwhile, Hatchan (former  Arlong Pirates crew member, now takoyaki salesman), who is tied up in front of Duval is both concerned about Camie and also afraid of hearing the Straw Hats' name mentioned again.

The  Thousand Sunny is spotted near the base and Duval is informed that "that man" is aboard the ship, whilst Hatchan tries to bribe Macro with takoyaki to release him, however it does not work. As the Sunny nears the base, Camie is worried that her friend is in danger.

The Straw Hats enter the base, and they notice it is too quiet. They find out that the base is not an island, but a small village built in the middle of the sea. Camie and Pappag call out to Hatchan, who after seeing the  Jolly Roger of the Straw Hats, covers himself in his own ink to disguise himself in order to protect his friends. The Straw Hats know that they are walking into a trap, but Camie and Pappag freak out when  Franky yells at them of how blind they are to the obvious. They find Hatchan in a cage in front them warning them about the trap.

The Straw Hats recognize the voice and shape of the octopus Fish-Man and Sanji tricks him to talk about  Arlong and his crew, revealing to the crew that Camie's friend Hatchan is really their former enemy, Hatchan of the Arlong Pirates. Camie is excited that they know him, but  Zoro states that they are not his friends and Nami is considering turning away. This makes Camie sad and Pappag angry at the Straw Hats, so they both jump into the sea only to be immediately captured by the Macro Pirates.

Fortunately, Nami convinces the other Straw Hats to save Camie and Pappag since after all, Camie and Pappag are their friends. Duval orders the Flying Fish Riders to attack whilst Luffy rescues Camie and Pappag using his  Devil Fruit  abilities and orders Zoro to free Hatchan and the rest of the Straw Hats to battle.

Hatchan asks Camie and Pappag to get out of the way, while the Macro Pirates fume over getting Camie back. Luffy says that he is ready for them all, while Camie and Pappag cheer for him. Zoro, Sanji and  Chopper prepare themselves as dozens of Flying Fish Riders emerge all around Thousand Sunny. Luffy is however distracted because of his fascination with the flying fish and tries to find one to ride - then grabs hold of one by holding on to the rider.

Meanwhile the Flying Fish Riders begin to bombard the ship, leaving Sanji to deflect all of the bombs being dropped. Luffy manages to pilot one of the fish, but the attack leader orders the entire crew to dive underwater including Luffy, which renders him helpless. Chopper and Brook try to save him only to realize that they cannot swim as well. This infuriates both Nami and Franky who rescue them while complaining about extra work that they caused. The Macro Pirates see an opportunity and try to capture Camie, only for them to find that Zoro has freed Hatchan from his cage while they were not looking. Hatchan defeats them quickly by uppercutting them into the air.

Hatchan reunites with Camie and Pappag, but they are attacked by a Flying Fish Rider, though they are quickly saved by Zoro. Hatchan thanks Zoro for rescuing him and tries to apologize for the events in the past.  Usopp defends the ship by using a cannon to shoot down the flying fish, with Chopper praising his skill. As the Straw Hats find out that there are a multitude of Flying Fish Riders in the sky, Brook becomes ashamed that he cannot lend a hand in his first fight as a Straw Hat pirate. He then unsheathes his blade and jumps high in the sky and uses his violin to unleash a musical sound wave that puts the riders as well as Chopper and Luffy to sleep.

This move allows Brook to perform a quick attack on the sleeping riders while running on water, and it also allows Luffy to grab a flying fish only to find it and its rider are asleep which causes him to plummet into Duval's room, wherein Luffy sees his unmasked face - with an extremely shocked reaction. Meanwhile, Brook spots that Zoro's wounds after his battle against Kuma still have not healed, however he tells Brook that he's fine enough to take on the Flying Fish Riders.

Hatchan complains to Zoro and Brook that they should still keep their guard up, but Camie and Pappag praise Hatchan. Hatchan turns his back and lowers his guard only to be attacked by another rider but is saved by both Zoro and Brook. As the group of Riders attack the Sunny, they fall to a combination attack of Nami's  Clima-Tact and Robin's clutch skills.

Chopper goes into  and attacks a fish and using a new technique - , which leaves a diamond-shaped impression on the fish's skin, while Franky uses  on a rider, after the above-mentioned realizes that bullets do not affect him. Camie and Pappag watch the battle, amazed by the strength of the Straw Hat crew. Usopp advises Franky that they must dock the ship because the riders have an advantage on open sea and Franky agrees with him but tells him that they can't because the Flying Fish Riders aren't giving them enough time to steer the ship.

Luffy appears running towards Zoro, Brook, Hatchan, Camie and Pappag, announcing that a giant iron masked man on a giant cow is approaching them, when they hear the bull's roar. They realize that it is the Duval's beloved bison,  Motobaro.

#### Duval's Tragedy[]

Duval shouts that he does not need the base anymore - his only wish is to kill the Straw Hats. He reveals that "that man" is none other than Sanji. The Straw Hat crew on the ship try to remember who he is, but Sanji draws a blank. Suddenly, Duval shoots his scorpion poisoned tipped harpoons at them and screams at him that it is something just recent - confusing Sanji even further.

As Sanji tries to tell Duval that he does not know him, Luffy tells Zoro that he has seen his face and that the whole Straw Hat crews knows this face well. As Luffy violently removes Duval's mask, it is shown to the whole crew and the riders that by a cruel twist of both fate and irony, Duval was born with a face that is a perfect replica of Sanji's wanted poster. Duval shouts that he wants his life back and that Marines and  bounty hunters have been after him since the poster appeared, but Sanji, upon seeing the face, leaves the Sunny, swims to the base dock, and immediately kicks Duval in the face, claiming he does not care.

Sanji and Duval argue with each other about the wanted poster, while the Straw Hats on the ship are amazed that something like this could happen - Franky has one of his emotional moments whilst the Straw Hats on the dock are amazed at what they are seeing. Brook just laughs (prompting Sanji to yell "Oh I'm so kicking your ass later, Brook"). Sanji argues to Duval that he could have changed his appearance all this time, making Duval and the riders sport a "why did not I think of that" face while Sanji remarks on their stupidity.

Duval reveals his past to everyone: He was once a mafia boss on a remote island doing his usual job until powerful bounty hunters and Marines came after him and forced to wear his iron mask to protect himself. Sanji beats him up and says he has had enough of his accusations. Duval orders his riders to reveal a steel fishing net and trap Sanji in it, dragging him into the sea.

Luffy tries to rescue Sanji and Zoro also tries to go in Luffy's place - however, Hatchan says that he's faster underwater and he will go. Duval then states that  Flying Fish are the fastest creatures underwater and it is futile to try to chase them. Suddenly, Camie jumps into the sea to rescue Sanji, and Pappag remarks that Duval is wrong; he agrees that the fish are fast but that there is nothing faster in the oceans than a mermaid. Luffy is amazed at this revelation, and Pappag says that if she keeps her guard up, Camie is uncatchable.

Whilst they were distracted by this, the Flying Fish Riders reveal that they are carrying a very huge anchor from an extraordinary large ship and are planning to drop it on the Thousand Sunny. Usopp asks Franky if they could use the "paddle" or  to get them away. Franky states that there is not enough time but reveals that he has built in a secret weapon for times like this. Reaching the bow of the ship, Franky tells everyone to believe in Sunny. As the Riders drop the anchor, Sunny's figurehead spins like a propeller revealing the emergency evasion secret weapon  to everyone and making the ship go into reverse.

The riders are baffled about the prospect of a reversible ship. Franky tells Usopp that there is a secret compartment inside the prowl and reveals a new feature of the Sunny, much to the excitement of Luffy and Chopper. A cannon reveals itself from within Sunny's figurehead's mouth, and Franky tells Usopp to get as many riders as he can. Usopp locks on and fires, revealing the incredible destructive power of the . Franky explains that it takes three barrels of cola for  and two barrels of cola for , warning them only to use it in emergencies.

Meanwhile, Camie manages to rescue Sanji and has trapped the Fish Riders in their own steel net. As Camie reaches the surface, Nami asks if Sanji is alright, and Camie says that he is safe but bleeding from his nose (due to his usual perverseness). Duval is now furious that Sanji is still alive, but Luffy remarks that his henchmen are now all gone. This further infuriates Duval, and he unleashes the full rage of his bison Motobaro onto Luffy.

But, to everyone's surprise, Luffy, reminiscent of  Shanks, somehow makes the bison drop his rider, trod a few feet away and then faint. The Straw Hats, including Luffy, are amazed and confused about how he did it, further angering Duval. However, at this point Sanji arrives back on the dock, and tells Luffy he will take care of the rest.

Just as Duval is about to attack, Sanji performs the same face bashing techniques that he did on  Wanze on the  Sea Train.

The Sunny is back at sea and the Straw Hats are heading for Sabaody Archipelago. They have a takoyaki party with Hatchan cooking. Chopper, Brook, Sanji, Usopp, and especially Luffy are gorging themselves, enjoying it thoroughly. Hatchan tentatively asks Nami if she likes it, to which she replies that she has not forgiven him yet, but likes his takoyaki nonetheless.

The entire crew enjoy the takoyaki (with even Sanji being amazed at the flavor), until the "eating trio" of Usopp, Luffy and Chopper can continue no longer (just as well as Hatchan collapses exhausted from trying to keep up with their servings). It is then that Duval, whose face has become handsome, finds them. He expresses his gratitude for the change (and gets into fits about his own beauty), then gives the crew his Den Den Mushi number, saying if they need anything to just call him up before he and his gang (now renamed the  Rosy Life Riders) depart.

#### The Islands of Bubbles and Nobles[]

The crew arrive at Sabaody (after Pappag and Camie explain to them about the two ways of getting to the New World: requesting permission from the government and passing through Mary GeoiseÂ or going through Fish-Man Island), and are amazed at its structure (large trees, blowing bubbles). Hatchan then says they will need a special coating to make sure the ship gets to Fish-Man Island all right. Hatchan promises to take them to a mechanic he would "bet his life on", but they have to promise not to oppose the  World Nobles, people who are allowed to live in Mary Geoise and are sometimes seen walking around Sabaody, even if someone were to be killed before their very eyes.

Usopp, Franky and Sanji stay on the Sunny to fix the damages to the ship (or in Sanji's case to look after the treasure at the behest of Nami) while the others explore the island. Zoro is the last to leave much to the shock of the others as they know of his lack of direction. But Zoro points out he just has to look at the numbers on the grove trees to remember where they are docked at, and to ask directions if his gets lost. The three agree to this though tell him not to trust himself while he remembers the number of the grove as "1". However, a bubble had floated in the way at the time revealing the grove to actually be "41".

Meanwhile Luffy, Nami, Chopper, Robin and Brook tour the island with Hatchan, Camie and Pappag acting as guides. Hatchan warning them not to draw attention to themselves as even though pirates walk freely on the island so do Marines and bounty hunters, plus if they are captured and sold as slaves the law will not help them. He also mentions to treat Camie and himself as regular people claiming it'll be easier for them (even bandaging the mark on his forehead, something Luffy notices).

After which, the Fish-Man shows the Straw Hats the wonders of island and how they make use of the bubbles, from making bikes out of them and using them for transportation to holding their souvenirs in balloon-like bubbles to even creating hotels and shopping malls out of them the latter of which Nami and Robin depart from the group. However, Robin cannot help but notice Camie acting reserved since they have reached the island.

No sooner than they leave the group, a Pirate Captain runs through the town, begging the citizens to remove a  collar from his neck. He pleas that he's given up on the new world and just wants to leave, even claiming he has a wife and child, the latter whose never even seen him since he was a baby. Hatchan, however, tells the group not to help him as he is a slave of the World Nobles. After mentioning this fact, the collar activates and blows up the captain though he surprisingly survives still feebly begging to leave while a shadowed figure holding an axe and bounty poster identifies the captain from above a building. Two nobles,  Rosward and his daughter,  Shalria, show up afterwards causing everyone to bow as they pass. After their dog  Saru urinates on the charred captain, Shalria kicks him before shooting him with a pistol, Luffy nearly attacks them after seeing this, but Hatchan stops him. Rosward and she then casually walk away talking buying another slave.

The group then talks about the oddity of it since the pirate looked strong enough to deal with both nobles. But Pappag comments that wounding one would make the offender the target of one the  Admirals. When asked what gives the nobles such special treatment, the starfish tells them that they are the descendants of the ones that created the  World Government, and due to this they have become abusive with their influence.

#### The Eleven Supernovas[]

Despite having witnessed the cruelty of the nobles, the group continue on encountering a few bounty hunters along the way. After Luffy, Chopper and Brook easily take care of them, the group find themselves in Grove 16 which Hatchan explains is a lawless region of the island. He goes on to explain that Grove 1-29 which make up the interior of the island are like this while the surrounding Groves house the entertainment and shopping districts. Finally, after a bit of traveling, they reach Grove 13 and a bar where the coating engineer is said to stay.

Upon entering, they meet the owner of the bar  Shakuyaku (Shakky for short), a former pirate and friend of Hatchan. After the usual meet and greet, Shakky reveals she has been following the Straw Hats' exploits and that she was even chased by Garp during her pirate career. When asked about the engineer  Rayleigh, Shakky tells them he is not there though has not left the island. When Luffy suggest waiting for him, she reveals that he has not been back in a half a year pretty much wandering the island's bars and casinos. Hearing this, the group agree on searching for him to which Shakky warns them to be careful in doing so, as since the Straw Hats arrival, that now makes eleven  rookie pirates with over 100,000,000 bounties on them that have reached the Red Line, Luffy being the second highest of the ranks in terms of bounties.

Most of the  Supernovas are staying in Grove 24. First off comes  Capone "Gang" Bege (138,000,000), a mafia-type pirate who is dining at a restaurant and complaining of the food. When one of his  crew tries to warn him of the Marines, he attacks him with a fork. Then "Big Eater"  Jewelry Bonney (140,000,000), who's in the same restaurant, is living up to her title by eating an enormous amount of food and demanding more of it despite the cooks going as fast as they can. There is also "The Magician"  Basil Hawkins (249,000,000), who tells a pirate who got spaghetti spilled on him that it's an unlucky day for him. In another section of the grove, two of the rookies  Eustass "Captain" Kid (315,000,000) and "Roar of the Sea"  Scratchmen Apoo (198,000,000) are fighting against one another.

Meanwhile, in Grove 21, two more pirates are doing the same: "The Mad Monk"  Urouge (108,000,000), a  Birkan, and a masked individual called "Massacre Soldier"  Killer (162,000,000) are about to go all out until "Red Flag"  X Drake (222,000,000), a former Marine officer, breaks the two up. As Drake walks on, the last of the rookies, "Surgeon of Death"  Trafalgar Law (200,000,000), asks him how many people he's killed.

Shakky tells them all the pirates beyond this point are the best of the best. She also reveals that Kid only has a higher bounty than Luffy himself because he caused damage to civilians and that she's rooting for the Straw Hats. Even after hearing this, Luffy responds that he will just relax for the time being but is a bit worried for the engineer. However, Shakky tells him Rayleigh will be fine because he's far stronger than the rookies.

#### Kidnapped![]

Finished at the bar, Luffy's group soon head out to look for Rayleigh. Shakky sees them off, informing them that although the Marines are aware of some of the big names on the island, they have their hands full with another matter and gives one last warning not to make a big scene before they head out. Meanwhile in another section, another kidnapping group led by a large individual named 'Hound Pets'  Peterman has found out about Camie being a mermaid through the bounty hunters the Straw Hats encountered earlier and plans to kidnap her. Luffy's group reach Groves 32, 33 and 34, also known as Bubbles Island which is the haven of  Sabaody Park, the theme park of the island and begin their "search" there. Though moreover spend their search riding the rides and having good time, even fulfilling Camie's dream of riding the Ferris wheel. However, unknown to them, they are being followed by Peterman.

Meanwhile in Grove 24, we meet another noble, Saint  Charlos, who was left behind by Shalria and their father, which he blames on the pirate he was riding on like a horse by kicking him. Charlos then spots some doctors transporting a gravely injured man by stretcher and stops them. Charlos is insulted by their supposed lack of respect for him. He then spots the nurse with them and instantly claims her to be his wife. Both the nurse, named  Marie, and one of the doctors, who incidentally is her fiancÃ©e, object to this which Charlos responds by shooting the man with his pistol much to Marie's horror. Charlos then has his servant take Marie away as she pleads for someone to help her lover. Zoro just happens to walk by, ignorant of the rules about nobles. He catches the attention of Charlos who steps in his way.

Zoro asks if he needs directions which angers Charlos, the noble instantly pulls his pistol on Zoro and fires. But the swordsman easily dodges and goes for a counterattack. Bonney, however, tackles Zoro into the ground before he can do so, putting up an act as if he was shot and killed. Charlos, at first thinking Zoro dodged, shrugs it off and buys it before he and his subordinates go on their way. Once gone, Bonney instantly chastises Zoro for his actions and almost bringing the Admirals on them. Zoro, however, is clueless to the whole situation while most of the Supernovas, who were watching and commenting on everything, are impressed by his strength and murderous intent. Zoro then picks up the doctor that was shot and goes to locate a hospital, much to the confusion of Bonney since after all he is a pirate.

Back on the Sunny, Franky, Usopp and Sanji are taking a break when Chopper calls them on their Den Den Mushi. He frantically informs them that Camie was kidnapped. Peterman's gang somehow got the drop on Luffy's group and manage to steal her away, making matters worse is that they do not know which group took her and where she is since the island is very big and there are many human shops. Sanji tells them to stand by, since they are dealing with a kidnapping gang, they need experts in this field. Sanji then reveals he's calling the Flying Fish Riders.

Duval and his gang soon reach the Thousand Sunny. But soon he and the Straw Hats get to the task at hand. Back at Sabaody Park, Luffy, Hatchan and Pappag have split off to search for Camie despite Sanji telling them to stay put, leaving Chopper and Brook behind. The Fish Riders reach them, and they set off to search. The Flying Fish Riders then split up to find kidnapping teams while a few go off to collect the remaining Straw Hats.

Meanwhile in a human shop in Grove 22, Luffy shaking down the owner on if they have Camie, but the shop does not. The three leave with Luffy and Pappag shouting out for Camie and drawing attention to themselves. Pappag cries, blaming himself for the mermaid kidnapping as it was when he went to go get ice cream for Camie when she was abducted. The starfish then goes on about how he shouldn't have brought her to the island in the first place, claiming it wasn't just kidnappers but the whole island is their enemy. In a shopping mall in Grove 30, Robin explains to Nami the history of the relationship between human, fish, and mermen. Two hundred years ago, the Fish-Men race was classified as just that, fish, and were persecuted by humans. Even with their superior strength, human numbers outweighed their own with kidnapping and slave trade being the most common of methods on the Fish-Men. Finally, the World Government signed a treaty with Fish-Man Island and these methods were abolished though Sabaody Archipelago still continues this trade. As she finishes the explanation with her theory on why Hatchan and Camie have to hide their true form, some of the Fish Riders arrive with Franky quickly explaining what happen to Camie.

Back in Grove 22, Pappag also finishes explaining this story to Luffy and continues to rant about not letting Camie come to the island. Hatchan tries to apologize for the trouble, but Luffy dismisses the apology by telling them they have done nothing wrong and tells the two that all three of them are their friends now and that he vows to save Camie no matter what. Just as he makes this claim, they spot the Flying Fish Riders heading toward them. Meanwhile, in Grove 1, home to a human auction ground, Peterman has just left the ground, having given them Camie while Rosward and Shalria soon arrive at the house. Also, there are Kid, Killer and their  crew, as well as Trafalgar Law. Meanwhile, in the waiting room of the building, Camie is brought before the head auctioneer named  Disco who is excited to have a young mermaid in the auction. Camie yells that Hatchan will make them pay which earns her a slap and beating from Disco though the pleas of his subordinates stop him as he "damaging the merchandise". However, Camie still presses her threat, before Disco can become angrier with her though he suddenly passes out.

As his staff rush to find a doctor, one of the captives, a  giant, tells another that he knows he was the cause of Disco fainting with his "burst of spirit". When asked who he is, the culprit just claims he's an old man that cannot ignore a young girl. This man turns out to beÂ Silvers Rayleigh, former  First Mate of the  Roger Pirates, The Pirate King's Right Hand.

#### The Auction House Incident[]

At a Marine base, it is revealed to Garp that Rayleigh is being sold at the  auction house, who comments that he probably is selling himself to pay off a gambling debt. He also tells the Marine reporting to him not to mention this to anyone else and that he will take care of it. Garp says that Rayleigh is not to be underestimated just because of his age and many good men could be hurt or worse if handled the wrong way.

The auction soon begins with a pirate musician and winemaker being the opening item as the Straw Hats continue their search. While questioning the kidnapping team that brought the giant mentions a mermaid at the auction house to Usopp, who alerts the others searching. Duval is berated by Sanji for traveling so slowly, but Duval reveals that he was heading to Grove 1 all along. They meet Chopper there with Franky, Nami, Pappag, and Hatchan following shortly, while the others are on their way with Zoro lost on foot.

After questioning an employee who refuses to help them, Franky suggests using force to save Camie, but is reminded that the nobles could be inside and could alert the Admirals. Nami suggests they then play by their rules and try to buy Camie back, which causes Hatchan and Pappag to cry over her desire to help them and not being able to repay her. When entering the auction house, they are soon seen by Kid who notices Luffy is missing and wonders how big of an idiot Luffy really is.

Meanwhile, several of the other Supernovas are reading the paper, when they discover the reason behind the Marine shortage in Sabaody even though they are so close to Marine Headquarters.  Ace has been scheduled for a public execution, which is commented that will bring  Whitebeard's wrath and start a war between him and the Marines.

Back at the auction, Charlos arrives and joins the other nobles there as the next auction, a pirate captain named  Lacuba, begins. However, before any bids are made, Lacuba's mouth suddenly starts bleeding before he promptly collapses. Disco quickly closes the curtain while Sanji comments that Lacuba bit his own tongue off, preferring to face death than slavery. With this incident, Disco decides it is time to bring out Camie next who's been fitted with an explosive collar and put into a fishbowl.

After much fanfare, Disco introduces Camie to the crowd prompting Nami to get ready to bid for her. However, Charlos blindsides her and everyone in the house with an instant bid of 500,000,000 with no one to outbid him. As Disco begins to close out Camie's auction, Luffy crashes into the auction house as the Fish Rider he was with could not land properly. Zoro is with the two as well having been picked up on the way to the house. The Straw Hats themselves were astounded by the sudden arrival of their two most powerful members, as was everyone else in the auction. Upon seeing Camie, Luffy rushes the stage despite the protest of Hatchan, who is forced to use his remaining arms to try and restrain him. This unfortunately reveals his identity as a Fish-Man to the crowd, and they immediately raise a panic, confirming Robin's earlier story of discrimination against Fish-Men.

A shot suddenly rings out, stopping the commotion. Charlos has shot Hatchan with his pistol, much to the horror of the Straw Hats, Pappag, and Camie, who pounds furiously on her fishbowl. Charlos then begins to gloat while Luffy makes his way towards the World Noble. Hatchan tries to stop him, reminding Luffy about the promise not to harm them and citing the fact that he was a pirate and that he deserved it anyway. He apologizes further, stating he only wanted to make up for his past actions to Nami and help any way he can but only got in the way. Charlos hears enough and tries to shoot him again. Luffy, already angered, no longer restrains himself, and not caring about the rules anymore, gets up and punches Charlos in the face.

The whole room is speechless after such an attack (save for Law and Kid who are amused). Luffy apologizes to his crew for the attack though they understand given the circumstances and were even indifferent (Zoro even commenting he wanted to slice Charlos), instead commenting that this recent development had just made everything less complicated as they are, after all, pirates. Rosward is obviously not pleased, sending the place into yet another panic. The audience quickly clears out to avoid the World Noble's wrath and the guards set upon the Straw Hats, and a fight ensues. While Rosward demands for an Admiral and shoots at Luffy (to no avail), Zoro slices Camie's fishbowl in half. More Fish Riders arrive, dropping off Brook, Robin and Usopp who accidentally falls on Rosward, knocking him out and sparking more of the guards' anger as they take it as an attack. Luffy tells the group that they would leave once Camie has rid herself of her collar, but Law informs him that the Marines already have the place surrounded. Shalria suddenly makes her way to Camie's fishbowl, intending to kill the mermaid. However, before she can pull the trigger, she suddenly faints.

The back wall is suddenly ripped open, revealing Rayleigh and the  giant prisoner from before. The giant states that Rayleigh was just there to take the auction house's money as well as any from whomever buys him, though Rayleigh adds that no one would buy an old man for a slave anyway. As the guards stand there in shock, confused as to what they should do about this new development, Rayleigh spots Hatchan and asks what he was doing there. Upon seeing Camie, however, he connects the dots before using another burst of spirit on the guards, knocking them all out. Rayleigh then spots Luffy, commenting that he has been waiting to meet him.

The news of Luffy hitting a World Noble quickly spreads throughout the island, causing more widespread panic. Most of the Supernovas quickly decide to leave the island to avoid the inevitable dispatch of an Admiral, though a few who are curious decide to stay behind and see which Admiral will come. At Mary Geoise, the news has reached Sengoku, who becomes greatly irritated upon hearing that it was Luffy who committed the act. A Marine informs him that the pirates have taken the World Nobles "hostage" at the Human Auctioning House (or "Public Employment Security Office" as he calls it) but have not yet given any demands. An Admiral,  Kizaru, speaks up suddenly, telling Sengoku that he will handle it.

Back at the auction house, Disco has called his boss, revealed to be  Donquixote Doflamingo, about the situation. However, Doflamingo has no interest in the conflict or the slavery trade anymore and leaves it to Disco, effectively abandoning it. He also states that the  Seven Warlords of the Sea have been called together to engage the  Whitebeard Pirates. As the Marines continue to mobilize outside the house, Rayleigh manages to remove the collar from Camie and throws it aside before it explodes without the need for a key, much to the astonishment of the Straw Hats and to the annoyance of Franky who had just found the keys; he throws them to the remaining slaves to free themselves. Rayleigh apologizes to Kid and Law for the blast from earlier, though comment they cannot be normal if they managed to survive it. Both brush it off, rather amazed to have run into the "Dark King" himself. Rayleigh replies that he is merely a simple coating-engineer now and warns not to use the former title as he would prefer to live a peaceful life. He then checks on Hatchan and thanks the Straw Hats for saving him before telling the group that they should leave. However, the Marines have the place covered by now and demand that they release the World Nobles.

Kid offers to take care of the Marines while the others escape. However, Luffy and Law seem to take it as an insult and join him in battle. The Straw Hats ready themselves for a fight and the giant slave from before offers to get the other slaves out while they thank the Straw Hats for freeing them. Back outside, the Marines open fire with mortars but Luffy and Kid reflect them back, with Luffy doing so using his  move, and the latter  repelling it using only his hand to do so. Law meanwhile covers an area with a spherical barrier using  his ability and cuts off one of the Marines' heads within the sphere, though the action does not kill him. Instead, he replaces it with a cannonball that promptly explodes hitting those that were near his decapitated body while Law holds the Marine's head in his hand. It now becomes clear that the two other Captains alongside Luffy are no mere pirates and the Marines realize that they are dealing with Devil Fruit users.

Despite this revelation, the Marines continue to press the attack. Luffy, Kid and Law easily destroy them all. Luffy uses his  technique, Law his  move as he chops up body parts and rearranges them on the Marines and Kid his power over metal as he forms an arm of said material and strikes at the Marines with it. Soon, the Straw Hats arrive and see the damage caused by the three captain's rampage. Rayleigh delights in all the mayhem being caused.

The Marines' reinforcements are deployed hoping to contain the offenders until Kizaru arrives. The pirates, however, have no intention of staying that long. Kid prepares to pull out and warns Luffy, stating that the next time they meet he will not be as merciful. Though Luffy replies that he will be the one to find the  One Piece which shocks Law and Kid. Kid then comments that anyone who makes that claim in the Grand Line would be laughed at, though in the New World anyone without the nerve to say something like that would be as good as dead. He then concludes by telling Luffy and Law that they should all meet in the New World again someday. With that, he and his crew bowl through the Marines and head out. Law decides to head back to the auction house as his bear,  Bepo, defends him. The Straw Hats soon join the fray, spotting Duval and the Fish Riders. The Marines prepare to shoot him, but Robin saves Duval before they can do so. The others clear a path for Franky and Rayleigh to get Camie, Hatchan and Pappag out first before they follow. Nami covers their escape with a .

Law soon emerges from the house with a slave who was under the Nobles,  Jean Bart, a former pirate captain who joins his  crew as thanks for freeing him, though Law states that half of his thanks should go to Luffy. Meanwhile, Kid's crew manages to clear the house and destroys a bridge to keep the Marines at bay. However, just when it seems they will get away, Kid is suddenly hit. To their horror, the culprit blocking their escape is one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Bartholomew Kuma.

#### The Truth About Roger and the Admiral's Arrival[]

The Heart Pirates are still fighting off the remaining Marines at the auction house, tearing through them to escape. However, they come across the Kid Pirates, most of whom are already wounded due to Kuma. The Warlord of the Sea immediately identifies and attacks Law, but Law manages to dodge the attack. With the Marines starting to close in from behind, Kid and Law, despite their mutual dislike of the other, tell Kuma they are leaving and prepare to face him. In Grove 8, Peterman has been thrashed by the Straw Hats and the Rosy Life Riders for his earlier abduction of Camie. After giving back Camie's backpack, they depart promising to aid them till they leave the island. The Straw Hats then head back to Shakky's bar to treat Hatchan's gun wound.

As they do so, they talk with Rayleigh where he reveals he was a member of  Gol D. Roger's crew and served as his first mate, much to their surprise (Hatchan apparently knew this too but did not tell them since they just needed a coating-engineer). Rayleigh also reveals how he met Hatchan (the Fish-Man had saved Rayleigh's life when he was a kid, and they had remained friends till Hatchan joined Arlong's crew then named the  Sun Pirates). Sanji then questions how he could still be alive if Roger's crew were captured, to which Rayleigh reveals that Roger actually turned himself in. The government just made it seem that way to show their strength to the public. Rayleigh goes on to tell the reason why was because four years before he was executed, Roger came down with an incurable disease. His crew, however, came across  Crocus at the entrance of the Grand Line and asked him to join Roger on his final journey to keep his disease in check.

Finally, after three years they had managed to conquer the Grand Line. This surprises the Straw Hats, Brook especially, since Crocus did reveal to them that he was a pirate doctor for a time. Rayleigh even tell them that the reason Crocus joined was to find a certain pirate crew which the Straw Hats figure must have been the  Rumbar Pirates, bringing tears to Brook's eye sockets. Rayleigh continues, telling them that after they conquered the sea, Roger was dubbed the Pirate King. However, the title was meaningless since he was about to die. But Roger enjoyed it anyway through parties and fighting as a way to coop with the future. Eventually, Roger disbanded his crew who silently went their separate ways, fates unknown.

One year later, Roger turned himself in to the Marines who decided to make a public execution of him to throw fear into pirates around the world. However, Roger had other plans, his last words to Rayleigh being "I ain't gonna die, partner". Then on the fateful day of his execution, Roger made his famous speech to the world which in turned created the current age of piracy. The Straw Hats are astonished by the story. Rayleigh then tells the group about  Buggy and Shanks'  apprenticeship aboard  Roger's ship, the latter of which ran into Rayleigh ten years afterward who told Rayleigh about Luffy, claiming that had met a kid that said the same things as their captain did.

The story suddenly shifts to a harbor at Grove 27, where a pirate crew is about to set off. Before they can do so, they spot a ship on the horizon that suddenly fires a cannonball with a person actually standing on top it. The ball lands in the harbor amidst the pirates and the figure, revealed to be Kizaru, awaits orders from his Den Den Mushi.

Back at Shakky's, Rayleigh congratulates Luffy for making it this far into the Grand Line and offers to do the coating job for free much to the Straw Hats' pleasure. Robin then asks him about the  Void Century, telling Rayleigh about a note written by Roger on the  Poneglyph in  Skypiea. Rayleigh explains that the Roger Pirates did indeed find out the whole history, though he advises her to continue looking for it on her own. Rayleigh says that maybe she could reach different conclusions than those that they reached. Still, he offers to reveal it to her, but Robin politely turns him down agreeing with his earlier advice. Rayleigh also reveals that Roger could not decipher everything, like a genius such as  Clover. Roger just "could hear the  voice of all things". Usopp then ask Robin if she would want to let an opportunity like this get away and start to question Rayleigh about the One Piece. However, Luffy stops him demanding that the mystery of the treasure remain hidden since countless pirates were risking their lives just to search for it. He then threatens to quit being a pirate if any of the crew asked Rayleigh about it stating, "I DON'T WANT TO GO ON A BORING ADVENTURE LIKE THAT!!!"

Usopp apologizes for his actions before Rayleigh asks Luffy if he can really conquer the Grand Line. Luffy replies that he does not really intend to conquer it, only that the person with the most freedom in the ocean would be the Pirate King, which brings a smile to Rayleigh and Shakky's faces. Rayleigh then tells the crew he will have their ship coated in three days which until then, the crew will have to avoid trouble. Thus, the Straw Hats decide their best bet is to split up and draw attention away from the shop. Shakky gives each member a  Vivre Card so they can find their way back to Rayleigh once the coating is finished who decides to move the Thousand Sunny to a safer location. With that, they bid Hatchan, Camie, Pappag, and Shakky farewell for the time being and head back into the groves. Luffy suggests hiding in the theme park though the others (save for Chopper and Brook) reject this idea.

In Grove 27, pirates are trying their best to distance themselves from Kizaru. One pirate tries to shoot the Admiral, but the shot does not even seem to faze him. Kizaru then blurs in front of them trying to ask them where he can find someone named  Sentomaru but the pirates run away in fear. Kizaru then attacks them with light coming from his foot which he kicks out outward. This not only hits the pirates, but also topples a mangrove in the process much to the disapproval of his troops. However, Apoo, who is nearby, does not seem impressed by his power. In another part of the area, a few of the Marines have been  turned into either old men or children, the culprit of such being Bonney who laughs at them as she stuffs her face. A few more Marines encounter and surround Capone, but he informs them they have already lost. Kizaru then come across Hawkins whose  crew wish for him to run, he calmly tells them though that today is not his day to die. Back with the Straw Hats, as Usopp tries to convince Luffy not to go back to the amusement park, a figure stands before them prompting Luffy to ask who he is.

#### Sabaody in Chaos[]

The Marines confronting Capone quickly find out, to their bewilderment, what he meant by his earlier statement as he reveals his  ability and opens up compartments on his chest. Inside are his crew, now miniatures, who quickly attack the Marines with cannons before charging at them on horses. In both cases growing to normal size once outside of Capone to overrun the squad. In Grove 41, Urouge has an encounter with Kuma and is having difficulty fighting him. Meanwhile, back in Grove 24, Hawkins's crew keep pleading for him to run as Kizaru approaches but the captain is more focused on his pack of tarot cards. Reading his chances of fighting Kizaru, running from him, defending himself, and probability of death after the encounter, the last of which reads zero percent.

Hawkins then tell Kizaru that he has not seen the person he's looking for. Kizaru then replies he gets bored easily and that he cannot let a high bounty like Hawkins get away before using his  ability to deliver a "speed of light" kick at him then firing off another shot from his fingers. However, in Grove 27 and the harbor, two pirates suddenly double over from pain, getting hit from seemingly out of nowhere. It then revealed that Hawkins used his  voodoo-like ability and transferred both of the attacks to dolls that grow on his right arm.

Urouge suddenly toppled by them, bruised badly and citing his bad luck at running into a Warlord of the Sea and, upon seeing Kizaru, an Admiral as well. Hawkins informs him that the shadow of death is not upon him yet though he takes this news as a joke. X Drake suddenly appears and kicks Kuma aside. Kizaru instantly recognizes the pirate while X Drake comments he wasn't trying to run into an Admiral. Urouge then recovers and increases in size becoming huge. Now ready for a counterattack while Apoo continues to look on from a roof enjoying what's occurring before him.

Back in Grove 12, the Straw Hats encounter yet another Kuma who fires a beam at Luffy though he manages to dodge it (as well as be amazed by it alongside Chopper). His crew then inform him of their encounter with Kuma on Thriller Bark before Franky fires a  on the Warlord of the Sea in retaliation for that attack, knocking him back. Realizing that Kuma is very strong, Luffy goes into  while Sanji and Zoro prepare to attack as well though the latter realizes that this Kuma seems different from their previous encounter. Meanwhile, in Grove 49, the axe-wielding shadowed figure from before commenting Kizaru is late and that if he does not hurry there will not be anything left.

Back at Grove 12, Franky, Usopp and Brook just barely avoid a blast from the Kuma they are facing. As Kuma goes to fire again, Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro rush him and perform a combo attack, managing to knock him down. Luffy then questions on if the Kuma they're fighting is a fake, to which Sanji and Zoro question as well due to this Kuma's attack style not fitting the one that they faced before. The three then come to the conclusion that there's more than one Kuma running around.

Meanwhile, Urouge is pounding away at the Kuma he's fighting but is shot in the shoulder in retaliation. X Drake notes that Doctor  Vegapunk has even managed to integrate Kizaru's light-based powers into the  Pacifista  cyborgs. Kuma then attacks Drake who retaliates with his rare  Ancient Zoan Devil Fruit and manages to injure Kuma though he gets injured in the process as well. Urouge takes note of the Kuma's injury too but is kicked from behind by Kizaru through three buildings. Seeing this, Hawkins transforms into a large voodoo doll-like creature and attacks Kizaru but is easily repelled. Just when it seems Kizaru will finish him off, he's saved by Apoo who severs Kizaru's right arm before exploding him with a blast of sound.

Apoo starts gloating and leaves the scene only for Kizaru to suddenly appear before Apoo as a ray of blinding light and kick him straight through a building. Immediately afterwards, Kizaru sends Drake flying and defeats Hawkins by blasting him with a laser through his body. With all 4 of the Supernovas defeated he is contacted by the axe-wielding figure who yells at him, he decides to then go after either Law, Kid or Luffy.

Meanwhile, all the Straw Hats work together to bring down the Kuma clone; Zoro, who was still hurt from his wounds on Thriller Bark, struggles to stand up and Sanji tells Luffy to first bring down the clone before tending to Zoro's injuries, though the former notes that Zoro is still suffering from the aftermath of the events that occurred in Thriller Bark. Chopper uses  on Kuma, enraging him and causing him to try and blast Chopper only for Franky to nail him with his . Kuma easily sends Franky flying, but Franky is saved by Robin, who uses her  to catch him. Brook tries to attack him from above only for Kuma to try and blast him, but he is saved by Usopp when he uses  to distract Kuma.

Suddenly, it seems like Usopp's attack managed to injure it badly, Franky notes that the Kuma clone is like him; enhanced with weapons but still only human and that one of Usopp's explosive projectiles must have gone inside his mouth and dealt severe internal damage. Kuma tries to blow them all away with a laser from his mouth only for his mouth to be clamped shut by Robin causing to shoot himself, Nami quickly strikes him with a . This, however, only causes Kuma to go berserk. Sanji uses  to knock him back, Zoro uses  and  to damage Kuma before Luffy uses  and  to finish him off.

#### The Straw Hat Pirates: Conquered and Divided[]

After the battle, the Straw Hats are completely wiped, having had to use all their strength just to fight the Kuma. They soon start to discuss what to do next when someone calls out to them. Out from the sky drops the axe-wielding figure, along with yet another Kuma cyborg, in the middle of the Straw Hats. The figure introduces himself as Sentomaru and the Kuma clone known as a Pacifista, PX-1 (the one the Straw Hats defeated was PX-4).

PX-1 soon fires on the group forcing the Straw Hats to dodge. This prompts Luffy to decides they must now split up and run. Sanji sticks with Nami with Franky tagging along. Usopp goes with Zoro with Brook joining as well out of concern for Zoro's injuries. Leaving Luffy, Robin, and Chopper together. The three groups run in different direction promising to meet up in three days.

Usopp tries to cover their escape with a . But PX-1 blows up a bridge preventing Sanji's group from escaping before appearing right in front of them. Sentomaru goes for Luffy's group prompting Luffy to try to  him. Sentomaru easily deflects the attack with his palms and sends him flying much to Luffy's shock. Sentomaru then hits him again and knocks Luffy into a tree, managing to actually hurt him as the Marine reveals he not a Devil Fruit user. An explosion nearby halts the fight, which Luffy notices it came from where Zoro's group ran.

Indeed, his group ran into the worse possible scenario as Kizaru reveals himself before them. Zoro himself has taken the brunt of the Admiral's attack and compounded with his previous injuries, can no longer move while Brook and Usopp try desperately to keep Kizaru from killing Zoro.

However, none of their attacks work since, as Kizaru reveals, he ate the Pika Pika no Mi, a  Logia-type that essentially makes him a light man. Kizaru then goes to finish Zoro off, but the attack is suddenly thwarted by Rayleigh's intervention who manages to kick Kizaru's leg and divert the light attack. Kizaru greets the "Dark King" while Rayleigh tells him not to pluck the fine sprouts (i.e., the Straw Hats) since their era is just beginning.

Afterwards, Luffy orders for everyone to concentrate on running away, telling them they cannot fight. They all start to run, with Franky using a  to distance himself, Nami and Sanji from the Pacifista. Kizaru however, heads for Zoro's direction to attack him, but Rayleigh stops him in his tracks, even managing to cut his cheek. Afterwards, the Pacifista begins to attack Zoro, but is temporarily stopped by Sanji and Brook, both of whom are quickly defeated. Luffy is then attacked by Sentomaru and knocked into one of the mangrove trees. Rayleigh and Kizaru begin a sword fight, with Kizaru using a light sword. The Pacifista then attacks Usopp, causing him to drop Zoro. Chopper enters  to try to help. The Pacifista is stopped from its attack by the real Bartholomew Kuma, who then asks if Zoro were to go on a trip, where would he like to go. Zoro then disappears right in front of Usopp's eyes.

The crew is completely shocked by Zoro's disappearance. Luffy demands to know what has happened to him to which Sentomaru unwittingly answers, telling him if a person touched by Kuma's paw, they go flying for three days though where they end up is uncertain. Sanji and Usopp continue to question where Zoro is just as PX-1 prepares to fire at them from behind. Kuma, however, warps to it and makes it disappear confusing both the Straw Hats and Sentomaru. Luffy yells for the remaining Straw Hats to run to which they oblige. Kuma however advances on the injured Straw Hats (Sanji, Usopp and Brook) prompting Brook to try to defend the latter two. However, he is vanished by Kuma.

Sanji quickly gathers himself and goes for an attack but is easily knocked aside leaving Usopp to himself. He tries to fire a star but vanishes before he can do so. Angered, Sanji rushes to Kuma again but is vanished as well. Luffy is quickly losing his morale after seeing four of crew disappear right before his eyes while Rayleigh continues to battle Kizaru.

Kuma passes by them and whispers something to Rayleigh prompting him to question what he is doing. Kizaru inquires as well but Kuma brushes him off. Luffy then enters , Kuma ignores him and goes for Franky and Nami. Franky launches a  striking Kuma directly in his face but showed no sign of harm to him. Luffy launches himself at Kuma in  with a strong punch, but Kuma catches his fist easily and tosses him side.

Luffy's efforts does not deter the Warlord before he causes Franky to vanish. Nami is next to go as she is in the midst of calling Luffy for help. Luffy again tries to attack Kuma, but he warps to Robin and Monster Chopper, causing them both to vanish despite Luffy's pleas for him to stop.

Now alone, Luffy loses any remaining will to fight and collapses to the ground in despair. Berating himself for not being able to save even one of his friends. Kuma then appears before Luffy, paw raised, he tells the captain they will not meet each other again before Luffy too disappears at his touch. A caption then comes up saying that on this day in Grove 12 of the Sabaody Archipelago, the Straw Hats were completely and utterly defeated.

### __Amazon Lily Arc__

#### Last Thoughts from Sabaody

In Grove 41,  Duval and his  Rosy Life Riders, despite worrying about the  Straw Hats, decide to watch over the  Thousand Sunny until it can be coated so it can travel to  Fish-Man Island. In Grove 1, at the  auction house, Saint  Shalria is complaining to the  Marines about their lack of seriousness towards the Straw Hat Pirates and also why they haven't been captured yet. It is also seen that she vows to show them hell on Earth. At  Shakky's Rip-off Bar,  Camie is also worried about the Straw Hats, though  Pappag and  Hatchan think otherwise.  Shakky remains neutral about commenting on them facing an  Admiral, before remarking that this  pirate age is slowly beginning to move.

#### Luffy's Arrival

Then there's  Luffy, who's flying over the ocean due to  Kuma's  power, asking aloud on where his crew had vanished to and also worrying about landing in the ocean. Presumably after three days of flight, he lands on an island in a paw-shaped crater. After recovering from the impact, Luffy sets about heading back to  Sabaody Archipelago with the help of the  Vivre Card. He makes good headway until he reaches a mountain and tries to plow through it with a  but is too weak to do so. He notices a wild boar near him, which he defeats, and cooks it over a campfire. He eats it with a slight remembrance to the training  Garp put him through with some fondness. He notices a mushroom known as a  Laughing Mushroom growing nearby and eats it to cheer himself up. He then notices more and eats them too though they seem to have different effects on him.

Sometime later, a trio of women named  Marguerite,  Sweet Pea and  Aphelandra happen upon his unconscious body which is covered in mushrooms. Marguerite identifies it as  "Mushrooms-growing-out-of-your-body" Mushroom, which can suck the life force out of its victim should they remain. They take Luffy back to their village where another woman named  Belladonna helps them in ridding Luffy of the fungus by plucking and burning them off his skin (though overdoing it on the latter, knocking him unconscious just as he was starting to wake up). The group then proceed to wash him while others in the village, all women, look on. Sweet Pea notices there another "mushroom" in between Luffy's legs that they cannot seem to pull off despite numerous attempts. At this point, their Elder  Nyon comes across the scene, immediately identifying Luffy as a man which sends the whole village into a state of panic. Up until that point they'd thought he was a girl. We're then informed that this island is the home of the  Kuja, a tribe of female warriors and the island is called  Amazon Lily, a place said one should never set foot on if you value your life.

#### Kuja Island

The island's culture is finally explained: Amazon Lily is a land of all women, though on occasion a few set sail and give birth before coming back. Oddly enough, all of the resident's children have all been girls and are raised from birth to become strong fighters and workers. However, if any man were to set foot on the island, they would be eliminated on the spot. In a huge hole at the top of the island's mountain is where the central village lays and thus is where we find Luffy, whose been put into a jail cell after the Amazons had discovered his gender.

Now conscious, he finds himself being stared at by most of the residents who comment on his habits (as most have never seen a man before) misinterpreting them as how a normal man acts. Luffy especially shocks them when he takes back his  straw hat from Sweet Pea using his  stretching powers. After revealing his name, as well as answering a question on what's between his legs (referring to his genitals) which Luffy answers as "Kintama" ("balls of gold"), they are amazed and ask to give his genitals to them so that they can see. This makes Luffy freak out, claiming that they're trying to kill him. The Amazons then give him some new clothes due to his old ones being worn out. However, his new ones are rather girly-looking, and he freaks out.

The outburst leads to some of the Amazons becoming defensive, thinking Luffy was becoming vicious. One of the Amazons,  Kikyo, takes initiative by aiming her snake bow and arrow at him, while the other women follow suit. After Belladonna reveals they had saved him, Luffy apologizes for his outburst and thanks them for doing so, but Kikyo also reveals there is a ban on men on the island and they would have to kill him anyway. She also wishes to do so to keep Marguerite, Sweet Pea and Aphelandra from getting into trouble with their leader. Luffy tries to plea with them to just let him go but they proceed to shoot anyway, forcing him to break out of his cell through the roof. The Amazons quickly set after him, managing to knock him to ground level though he was able to avoid their attacks. Realizing that his Vivre Card is still in his other trousers, which Marguerite is currently holding, he quickly grabs her, jumps out of the mountain and lands in the jungle via his . After distancing themselves a bit, Marguerite returns his Vivre Card to him. They get to know each other a little where she reveals that the island's empress,  Boa Hancock, is a pirate as well and that everyone on the island looks up to her. Back in the village, the other Amazons spot ships on the horizon realizing that the empress is on her way back. Kikyo then orders the Amazons into the jungle to find Luffy and eliminate him before their leader returns.

Back in said jungle, Marguerite has taken off the frills on Luffy's clothing. He thanks her, then heads off to find a way to leave the island and find his crew, still miffed about his defeat against  Kizaru,  Sentomaru, and Kuma. He asks Marguerite for a boat, but she tells him there are none on the island as Amazon Lily is within the  Calm Belt, which means no winds to move the ship and sea monsters roaming the waters. Marguerite also explains that Hancock's ship, the  Perfume Yuda, only manages to get around the water by using  Yuda, a poisonous type of sea serpent so dangerous that no  Sea King would dare to get close to. After hearing this, Luffy decides to build a raft to paddle his way out, but it's so poorly built that it quickly collapses upon entering the water, forcing Marguerite to save him. Marguerite then realizes she'll get in trouble if she gets too attached to him. This leads her to attack Luffy once more with her arrows, which she explains are imbued with  Haki, making them strong enough to easily break through rocks. If that wasn't bad enough, the rest of the Amazons have managed to find them. Luffy quickly turns tail while Sweet Pea informs Marguerite that their Snake Princess is coming back.

#### Snake Princess

Meanwhile out in the Calm Belt, a Marine ship and a pirate ship rest side by side together.  Vice Admiral  Momonga calls out for the pirate captain, a  Warlord of the Sea, to show herself. At first, the Amazon crew denies him their captain's audience but Boa Hancock eventually shows herself alongside her sisters  Boa Sandersonia and  Boa Marigold. Momonga shows her that the date for  Portgas D. Ace's execution has been set at one week from today and she is to attend, per her treaty with the  World Government to stay away from Amazon Lily, to help against the inevitable retaliation of  Whitebeard's crew or her title as a Warlord of the Sea is forfeit. Despite the threat, Hancock refuses to relinquish her title nor attend the gathering and instead brazenly tells the Vice Admiral that his Marine ship will have a little "accident" to retain her position. Momonga warns her that her title will be revoked should she refuse to heed the World Government's call, but she demonstrates her power over his crew by making them fall for her, then uses the power of the  Mero Mero no Mi to turn them all into stone. Momonga manages to avoid the attack by stabbing his hand to distract himself with the pain, then gives Hancock one last warning: If she does not return with him within two days, the treaty is void. Hancock merely tells him to do as he wishes.

With that, the  Kuja Pirates return to the island to a hero's welcome and start unloading the supplies they got from their trip, including that of the recent Marine ship they encountered. Hancock asks one of the Amazons if anything happened while she was away, but the Amazon denies it. Hancock heads back to her castle, and upon arrival, is presented by a gift from the younger Amazons, a statue of her made with mud and clay. More of her cruel personality is portrayed here when she knocks it down, breaking it, stating that it was crudely made. She also inquires why most of the warriors weren't at the harbor to meet her.  Enishidaâ, the one asked, lies that a dangerous "monkey" was on the island, and they went to go kill it to which Hancock brushes it off and goes to relax. Nyon suddenly shows up in the throne room and tries to convince here to take the World Government's order, since her Warlord title was the sole reason that the island was kept safe in the first place after marines found a way to cross the Calm Belt. When Hancock does not budge, Nyon attempts to show her the future through a crystal ball, but Hancock stops the process. Hancock then tells Nyon she does not care if the island is destroyed since everyone will forgive her before throwing her out a window. The elderly Amazon manages to land on her feet though, avoiding injury.

The Princess' bath time is soon announced and the Amazons in the castle are forced to leave and set up a perimeter around it, not allowing anyone in. One of the younger Amazons asks  Ran (who is part of Hancock's pirate crew) why they do the routine every day. Ran answers that in the past, there was a gorgon in the center of the sea that the Boa sisters managed to defeat. However, in its death, it placed a curse on the three in the form of its large eyes on their backs. If anyone were to see these eyes, they would turn to stone and therefore the castle is emptied and surrounded to supposedly protect the Amazons from this curse.

Back in the jungle, the warrior Amazons lose track of Luffy but realize that he probably went back up the mountainside and quickly rush back to the village. Meanwhile, Luffy is roaming on top of the castle wall trying to figure out what to do next. He decides the best course of action is to ask for a ship from the head of the island and figures she must be in one of the village's tallest buildings. With that, he jumps to the nearest building he can see and lands on the roof, but it caves in under his weight and sends him crashing through, attracting attention to the castle. Luffy drops into the bathtub where Hancock is currently bathing. After realizing he can stand in the water, he notices the Snake Princess naked yet does not turn to stone. Rather, he comments that he recognizes the mark on her back. Hancock turns to him with a menacing expression, angry that he saw it.

Hancock's sisters soon burst into the room to find Luffy standing there in the bath. Furious that Luffy saw her back (which also angers her sisters as well when she tells them what happened), she attempts to use her powers on Luffy, only to find they do not work. After a couple of tries, Luffy confuses her powers with that of  Foxy's  Noro Noro beam. Sandersonia queries that this is due to his fear of death being greater than the wicked desires in his heart. Realizing he's in a bad position, Luffy makes to escape by jumping out of bathhouse's window but is shot out of the sky by an attack from Hancock blowing a kiss, knocked him to the ground and being captured by the Amazons.

#### Trial of the Arena

He's brought to their Arena for his execution, where he's questioned before his death as to why he is there. Luffy tries to explain the events with Kuma to her, but she does not believe him and even pleading for a boat to simply just leave does not change her mind either. Suddenly, Marguerite speaks out, begging for her to spare Luffy and revealing that she was the one to bring him to the village, with Sweet Pea and Aphelandra soon trying to take the blame as well. Hancock approaches the warriors and proceeds to turn them to stone. Luffy demands why they have been turned to stone, which Hancock claims they were punished accordingly, and then orders to bring  Bacura to the arena to fight Luffy. Bacura is soon revealed to be a giant black panther who has served the Empress of Amazon Lily for generations and leaves not even the bones of his victims.

To the warrior's surprise, Luffy is able to defeat Bacura in one blow. Many begin questioning how he could without the use of Haki, and with just brute strength alone. Angered, Luffy demands to know how everyone could just sit there and laugh as Hancock turned the three warriors into stone for simply helping him. They claim they do feel sorry for them, but it was their own fault for breaking the laws, and Hancock states she will be forgiven since she is beautiful. She asks if Luffy, too, will forgive her, which he answers that she annoys him.

Unable to understand how any man can resist her, Hancock demands that Luffy is executed right away. As the crowd shouts for death, Hancock orders Marigold and Sandersonia to take Luffy's head for her. Luffy asks if the sisters are  Devil Fruit users as the crowd comments that they are able to use the Gorgon's curse and begin the , revealing the sisters appear in a  more snake- like forms as they surround Luffy. The crowd fawns over the cursed sisters which confuses Luffy as he correctly believes that they are just Devil Fruit users. Just as they prepare to fight, Luffy puts the statues of Marguerite, Sweet Pea and Aphelandra away so they wouldn't get damaged or broken and states that he's going to beat them up. Just before they fight, Marigold warns him not to fall and get impaled on the spikes below and attacks him.

Marigold has the ability to spit acid venom and later deflects Luffy's attack before striking him away with her weapon. Luffy is confused that physical blows can actually hurt him now and is suddenly captured by Sanderonia and is constricted. This is when Sandersonia realizes he also has a Devil Fruit power and predicts his kick before slamming him into the ground. Luffy quickly recovers and attacks Sandersonia only for her to predict and dodge all of his moves, during this he is sent flying by an attack from Marigold and nearly into the spike pit but manages to save himself at the last second. Hancock cheekily makes a remark at Luffy who promptly tells her to "Shut up, you dumb lady" causing her to collapse again before she orders his execution to be done immediately.

Her sisters, complying with her orders, constrict Luffy and prepare to destroy the statue of Marguerite despite his pleas. Just before Marguerite could be smashed to pieces, Luffy unleashes a devastating wave of Haki which freezes Marigold and Sandersonia as well as causing most of the audience to faint. The sisters quickly release Luffy and the statue while the audience, Marigold, Sandersonia and even Hancock herself are thunderstruck at Luffy for using  Haoshoku Haki, as the only other user they know of is Boa Hancock herself. She notices that Luffy has not mastered it yet. Luffy knows how powerful the two sisters are, and states that he's going to fight with everything he's got before taking a  stance.

Luffy goes into , astonishing the crowd with the steam coming out of him. Even so, Marigold and Sandersonia are not worried since Luffy cannot properly control his Haki yet. Sandersonia proceeds to attack by turning her hair into snake forms then charging at Luffy with them. He dodges the attacks, much to Sandersonia's surprise, as even though she can still read his movements, she cannot keep up with him to score a hit. Luffy manages to get an arm around her neck before smashing her into the ground. Marigold tries to swipe at him with her spear again, but he dodges, gets behind her and preforms . She reminds Luffy that she will just deflect the attack again, but it hits straight on. The impact nearly knocks Marigold out of the arena and breaks her spear in the process. The Kuja are speechless at seeing their two top warriors being handled so easily. Hancock is obviously not amused, asking her sisters what they are playing at. The two recover, nervously telling Hancock they'll deal with Luffy straight away.

Marigold then lights a match and sets herself on fire, but oddly does not feel it much to Luffy's surprise. Rather she creates salamanders from the flames while Sandersonia forms her snake hair once more, the two effectively surrounding Luffy on all sides. The Kuja cheer proclaiming that it's the sister's ultimate attack and Luffy has no way out. However, Luffy aims upward and preforms his  move on the hair and fire alike, stopping their attack. He then split kicks the sister's underbellies causing their upper halves to collide into each other. As Marigold is still on fire, Sandersonia is burned as a result. The two try to separate from one another but find that Luffy tied their tails together. Luffy flashes the victory sign while Sandersonia is in agony over being burned.

In desperation, she leans backwards too far nearly going into the spike pit. Luckily, she manages to grab onto the audience stand to save herself. Luffy suddenly jumps on her back which the audience and Sandersonia think he is trying finish her off. Sandersonia calls to Marigold to attack him, but she cannot. As she explains he the only thing protecting them. The Kuja realize that Sandersonia's clothes were burned off in the last attack and her position is exposing her back and thus the "Gorgon's eyes" to them. Luffy, remembering that Hancock would rather die than show the mark on her back, explains this to Sandersonia, telling her not to move. Hancock then orders the ceremony to be over and all the Kujas to evacuate which they all comply very quickly. Sandersonia then asks Luffy why protect them when they were just fighting moments ago. He answers that the thing they do not want anyone to see has nothing to do with their fight. Meanwhile Hancock sits on her throne covering her face, silently crying to herself.

#### Truth of the Mark

Afterwards, Sandersonia and Marigold revert to their human forms, apologizing to Hancock for losing the fight. Luffy asks the Kuja leader if she's gonna fight him next, but she denies it, citing that she's not in the mood anymore. Luffy shrugs it off and checks over Marguerite and then asks Hancock to change them back, claiming they only rescued him and did not deserve the punishment they were given. Hancock gives him a choice, she will either change them back or give him a boat to leave the island. Luffy instantly decides for reverting Marguerite and the others, shocking the Boa sisters and Nyon (who's still watching from the audience stand) at his selflessness. Later, Marguerite, Sweet Pea and Aphelandra leave the arena, now back to normal much to the joy of their fellow Kuja warriors. As the three were in stone, they couldn't remember much of what happened before the fight, only awakening to find Luffy next to them who was only glad that they were alright.

Meanwhile at the Kuja Castle, Luffy sits in the Empress Hall with Sandersonia and Marigold who thank him for keeping their secret safe. Though he is more interested in being fed. Hancock then calls him into her throne room (which is veiled) which he does eagerly thinking a feast is awaiting him. He is disappointed to find only a semi-naked Hancock who remarks that Luffy's rudeness is astounding. She turns her back and shows him the mark once more. Asking if he recognizes it, and after a closer observation, Luffy realizes that the mark he was thinking of was the one Hatchan had on his forehead which was more sun-shaped, they looked similar, so he had mistaken the one on her back for it.

Nyon suddenly shows up and convinces Hancock to tell him what the symbol means. She also tells Hancock of Luffy's actions on Sabaody, which she found out from the newspaper Ran gave her. When asked if it was true, Luffy confirms it, stating he did not regret hitting one of the  World Nobles, despite it being taboo. Hancock breaks down at that, surprised there was still someone else who was willing to stand up to them. She begins her story. At the age of twelve, she and her sisters were kidnapped from a Kuja ship by slave traders and sold into  slavery.

The World Nobles branded a mark on their backs called "Claw of the Celestial Dragon" which was meant to signify they were "less than human". For four years, they were treated cruelly and faced many hardships and horrors (Sandersonia cries out from the memories of it as Hancock continues the tale). One night, a  Fish-Man named  Fisher Tiger, who climbed the  Red Line with his bare hands, raided  Mary Geoise and set fire to it seeking to free all Fish-Men who were sold into slavery. While he hated humans, he did not discriminate the slaves that were there and freed them as well. The Boa sisters quickly escaped, claiming to owe him a debt for their freedom that they can never repay.

Hancock then goes on that Tiger took those Fish-Men that were slaves into his crew and modified the mark into a sun, thus creating the  Sun Pirates. Luffy asks if the mark meant Hatchan was once a slave, but Marigold and Sandersonia answer that might not be the case. As even though the mark was meant to hide the former slaves, it also could mean he was just part of the crew once. Nyon then reveals that Tiger is long since dead and his crew have split off into different factions. Hancock also reveals that the sisters were given Devil Fruits during their slavery which helped with the Gorgon story they created to hide their shame, and that her selfish attitude is only to keep her guard up as she does not want to be controlled again, even if she has to deceive an entire country. This seems to satisfy Nyon a bit since she was worried that Hancock's heart had turned to ice. When the Empress snaps at her, Nyon counters that it was her who found the sisters and guided them back to their land, even raising them as if they were her own children. Hancock then asks Luffy if he still scorns her, but he answers not anymore, just the World Nobles. This causes Hancock to smile and grant him a boat to leave the island, much to Luffy's joy.

#### Change of Plans

Hancock tells Luffy they would leave the following morning, so he occupies himself by entertaining the Kuja and sampling the food they gladly cook for him. However, the Amazon's curiosity over him, which lead into touching and prodding (one Kuja even charging money to do so), gets to Luffy as he tries to eat. Eventually he's forced to run from his newfound fans with assistance from Marguerite who thanks him for keeping her friends and herself safe in the arena before leading him to Nyon's hideaway. Luffy and Nyon begin a conversation as he eats in peace. The newspaper which Momonga gave to the Kuja, eventually passed to Elder Nyon, also provides information to her since news is hard to come by in the Calm Belt. Luffy is also informed about Hancock's Warlord of the Sea status (making him realize just how lucky he was that he did not find himself engaged against Hancock in combat while back at the arena, knowing from experience how powerful a Warlord of the Sea can be in battle), the coming war against Whitebeard and more importantly, that his brother Ace is going to be executed. After panicking and evaluating his options, Luffy alters his original intention of finding his crew to rescuing his brother. Nyon informs him that to get to  Impel Down where Ace is held, Luffy must convince Hancock to follow the World Government's orders as a Marine ship is the only fastest method to get to Impel Down before the execution.

Luffy and Nyon head for Kuja Castle where Enishida tells the two that Hancock had suddenly been struck sick. Belladonna has no clue what causing it, but Nyon knows as she once had it before, even mentioning that it was the reason she had to flee the island during her rule. She tells Hancock that Luffy has come to see her, which causes Hancock to surprisingly will herself into sitting up at the mention of his name and agrees to hear him out. Luffy asks Hancock if she could answer the call for the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Even though Hancock despises Mary Geoise and her sisters are against the idea (thinking Luffy is trying to take advantage of her), she cannot resist her desire to fulfill Luffy's wish. As it turns out, the illness is a  Love Sickness and Hancock has fallen in love with Luffy much to her family's shock. However, Nyon later reveals that this is a good thing as it was this sickness that killed the previous empresses, who tried to suppress their affections rather than admit them and died of broken hearts.

By helping Luffy, Hancock not only saves herself but helps keep Amazon Lily safe from the World Government by honoring their treaty. The Kuja pirate ship is readied straight away as Luffy says his goodbyes to the Kujas, personally thanking Marguerite and her friends for saving him and promising to return one day with his crew. With that, He and Hancock head out to meet Momonga where she restores his crew to living flesh. Luffy, strapped onto Hancock's back and hidden underneath the layers of her clothes, boards Momonga's ship as it sails for Impel Down.

#### War With Whitebeard Approaches: The Marines Bolster Their Forces

In the  Marine Headquarters,  Sengoku is informed of Hancock's change of heart and he is relieved as they need all the manpower they can get to go against Whitebeard, since  one of the Seven Warlords had already defected and refused to join the fight. He receives news that Whitebeard's 23-ship fleet had suddenly disappeared and that other pirate crews in the  New World were taking suspicious actions. Meanwhile, in Impel Down, Garp visits Ace in his cell. He tells Ace that war is imminent, regardless of whether or not he survives as the World Government has angered the "King of the Seas."

Tensions are running high, and a mass of Marine forces arrive at  Marineford as the day of Ace's execution draws near. In Mary Geoise,  Dracule Mihawk,  Gecko Moria,  Donquixote Doflamingo,  Marshall D. Teach, and Bartholomew Kuma, five of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, have gathered to meet with the Marines to plan for what was to come.

#### The Other Straw Hats

As Luffy and Hancock go to Impel Down, the fates of the other Straw Hats are shown.

When  Nami wakes up, she finds herself on a  Sky Island. This sky island is very small and one of the people living there, an  old man, tries to entertain her by showing her a wind knot and then demonstrating its applications (which unfortunately, only annoyed Nami even more). He then tells her that this small sky island is called  Weatheria, an island where the scientific study of weather is conducted.

Franky finds himself on a winter island where he is almost blasted by a projectile fired by a  hunter's pet  cyborg dog. When a man asks him if he wants to get some warm clothes he says, "I'd be a pervert disgrace!" And proceeded to perform some of his trademark poses (curiously, the men and dog who found him followed his example);  Karakuri Island is the name of the place where he landed. Two townspeople tell him that he is in the "Future Kingdom Barjimoa".

Sanji, however, has landed in what would probably be the worst place for him to be. Making a mental letter to Nami and  Robin, he notes that he is in hell; the kingdom of  Okamas,  Momoiro Island.

Usopp is on the  Boin Archipelago in the  Grand Line. He was attacked by many creatures within Glinstone, where he is saved by  Heracles. He is attacked by a man-eating plant, but Heracles saves him again. He is warned by the strange man that if he wishes to keep his life and his possessions then he should take great care within the forest.

Brook awakens on  Namakura Island, the land of poverty in the Grand Line. He finds demonic cultists around him, who think that he's a demon that they have attempted to summon in a ritual. They ask of him to destroy their enemies who robbed them, but Brook is only concerned about "getting back to the others". The cultist's get afraid and beg him not to go back to the "Demon Realm" with the other demons. They give Brook a sacrifice, a scared pretty girl. Brook asks her to see her panties, and all the cultists rush to find panties for "Satan-sama", as they call him.

In the  East Blue on the bridge  Tequila Wolf, Robin is questioning the foreman about the bridge and finds out it is where prisoners or citizens of countries that did not join the World Government end up. He says that they are brought there to build the bridge, which has been in construction for over 700 years. He then tells Robin to start working and it shows her in shackles.

Chopper wakes up in the  Torino Kingdom in the  South Blue, where he was found by two  gigantic birds who attempt to peck at him. Chopper, rendered immobile due to the aftermath of  Monster Point, falls out of their nest to avoid being eaten. He lands in front of a couple of natives residing on the island, where it's revealed that they're actually ruled over by the birds. They attempt to eat him but stop when they realize he can speak.

Perona is shown on  Kuraigana Island, complaining about not having any servants with her. Suddenly, she hears a crash and sees that  Zoro has crashed there, much to her discomfort. She bandages him up and puts him on a bed, and when he wakes up, he asks for his swords, but she refuses to give him his weapons.

Though the story moves back to Luffy, the Straw Hats' separate adventures continue on their  own cover stories.

### __Impel Down Arc__

#### The Break-In: Entering Hell[]

Garp visits  Ace at  Impel Down and expresses his disappointment that both  Luffy and Ace turned to  piracy when he wished for them to be  Marines. Ace counters it would not have mattered anyway since they have the blood of world class criminals in them. He goes on further explaining that he took  his mother's name "Portgas" out of love for her and does not care in the slightest of  his father, claiming  Whitebeard to be his only true father.

Meanwhile  Vice Admiral  Momonga's ship reaches one of the gates, spotting a  pirate ship as they near it. Momonga leaves it alone, trying to keep to his schedule of reaching Impel Down. The pirate ship turns out to be  Buggy the Clown's as his  crew tries to reach Impel Down to save their captain who has been captured. They are stopped as they get dangerously close to the  Calm Belt. The crew argues with  Alvida on whether to continue their mission or not, though she reminds them of the impossible nature of it all and seems more interested in taking Buggy's ship for herself. Upon realizing she is right; the crew wishes Buggy good luck and sails on.

We then go to the underwater prison and are given a glimpse inside its horrific structure. Prisoners are being tortured viciously. One new prisoner gets into a fight with another after other prisoners try to tell him how things work there. While the newbie manages to win, a  minotaur-like figure beats them both with his club then throws them into a cell where a monstrous being attacks them. Also shown are various devices used for torturing further implying the nature of the prison.

Meanwhile, four days have passed since Luffy and  Hancock left  Amazon Lily and Momonga's ship has finally reached the prison. As they go past the  gate, Luffy notices the strict security around the place. Hancock and Luffy (who is hiding in her robe) leave the ship to the main entrance. Momonga informs her that precautions will be made since she a former pirate to prevent chaos from happening within the prison. Among such being  Seastone handcuffs to nullify her power and a body search. The latter of which worries Hancock though Luffy tells her that he will take care of it. With that, Hancock and Luffy enter Impel Down while an official receives news that Buggy has escaped from his cell. Thirty-three hours remain before Ace's execution.

The group reaches the front gate where they are greeted by the  Vice Warden of Impel Down,  Hannyabal, who introduces himself and the Vice Head Jailer,  Domino. Hancock is taken to be searched, and along the way she is told of the prisoner entrance process as well as well who they are currently holding. Eventually Hancock is taken to a room to be searched by Domino. Before Domino can do so, however, Hancock freezes her, as well as the surveillance  Den Den Mushi, allowing Luffy to come out of her robe undiscovered. She tells him that this is as far as she can go and apologizes for not being able to help him further. But Luffy disagrees, thanking her for getting him that far (even calling her by her name which causes her to swoon). Before he leaves, Hancock makes him promise not to cause a ruckus as she does not wish to see him get caught, to which he agrees. Hancock leaves the room, restoring Domino in the process who has no memory of being turned to stone. The group then proceeds downward to Ace's cell, but before they go, Hancock sees Luffy ahead of them hiding in the ceiling mouthing "thank you" to her, though she misinterprets this as "I love you" and faints, much to the prison's staff surprise.

Meanwhile out in the sea, a few rather deformed beings called  Blugori slice up some  Sea Kings. The pieces are sucked into a compartment in the building. They reenter the prison from an underwater opening as an officer praises them for refilling the prison's food supply.

#### Crimson Hell: An Old Enemy Turned Comrade[]

On Level 1, Luffy begins his search for Ace, noting the vastness of the prison and the screaming being heard nearby constantly. He passes a few cells where the prisoners inside question on why he's out of a cell, astonished to learn he snuck in. Before they can go on further, something is heading towards Luffy. It turns out to be a prison escapee with a few Blugori close on his tail. They manage to catch up and slice the man in half. But the prisoner turns out to be Buggy who reassembles himself. He recognizes Luffy, forced to run from the creatures as well, beside him. After a bit of unusual chatting among one another on what to do next, they decide if they've already been spotted, they might as well call a truce, team up, and raise a ruckus. With that the two attack the Blugori together.

Buggy manages to escape from the axe of a Blugori with his  and tries to defeat it with , but failed to even harm him. Yet, Luffy defeats him in a single attack and saves Buggy, who was extremely shocked he took the guard down so quickly, remarking Luffy's improvement from the last time they met. Buggy then remembers the other four Blugori, only to realize Luffy had already defeated them. Buggy initially decides to escape, but after hearing Luffy mention the battleships waiting outside the prison, he decides to stay. Buggy suddenly spots the arm band that Luffy is wearing and immediately identifies it as the map to  Captain John's treasure.

He makes a deal with Luffy; he will escort him to Level 4 of Impel Down, but in return Luffy has to give him the arm band. Without hesitation, Luffy agrees. Buggy tells Luffy to pick his feet up, explaining that so long as his feet are on solid ground, or touching something on the ground, such as Luffy, he could fly within a set range. After Buggy mistakenly reveals the truth behind the armband, Luffy decides to give him the arm band in advance for helping him. Buggy feels guilty for lying to Luffy, but he decides nonetheless to escape from Luffy. Before Buggy can make good on his escape, he flies into a wall backwards. Luffy mistakes this as a shortcut through the wall and crashes into the Jailer's room and towards  Crimson Hell, the first level of Impel Down, which is a forest that has blade like leaves and grass. Prisoners are made to run through such a place while being chased by poisonous spiders, dyeing the forest red with blood due to cuts, hence the title of the level.

Luffy grabs hold of Buggy as they fall, while he throws Buggy's feet onto the ground as told, and they fly towards the entrance of Level 2, with Buggy's feet splitting apart to avoid the blade grass. Eventually the two reach a hole in the middle of the forest which Buggy explains leads to Level 2. Luffy immediately jumps down and heads towards Level 2 despite Buggy's warnings. Buggy shrugs this off and prepares to find another way to escape, but an attack by a pursuing Blugori knocks him into Level 2 as well.

#### Beast Hell: The Wax Man Offers His Aid[]

On Level 2, we can see residing in a cell, none other than  Mr. 3, appearing more ragged and with more facial hair than he had prior to his sentencing. He is surprised by the sudden rage of the Beasts of Hell on the level, but he does not care since he does not have the energy to be afraid anymore since all prisoners in Level 2:  Wild Beast Hell are their food anyway.

When Luffy and Buggy arrive on the floor, they meet a Basilisk, a snake born of a chicken, and make a run for it. Meanwhile, Boa Hancock is introduced to the Chief Warden in charge of Impel Down:  Magellan, a gigantic person with wide black wings, two horns with two parallel lines circling them, and a large coat. After a bit of discussion with Hannyabal, he accepts her proposal of seeing Fire Fist Ace, to Hannyabal's shock.

Back in Level 2, Luffy knocks out the Basilisk and unknowingly destroys the  Monitor Room in the process with , to Buggy's amazement.

Buggy hears the requests of the prisoners to free them and does so, including Mr. 3, with the keys on the floor of the former Monitor Room with the thought of making a riot to make it easier to escape. His thoughts are interrupted by Luffy, who pulls him by the neckband and says to him to hurry up and show the way to Level 3. Buggy retorts saying he actually does not remember how to go there nor to Level 4. He lied only for him to get Captain John's treasure map. Suddenly, he notices that the inmates have returned to their cells and closed them because, as one of them mentions, is useless to escape when there are still  Jailer Beasts around. Seeing his riot plan ruined, he promptly says to Luffy that he decided to lie to him again, telling him the way to Level 3. Luffy does not buy it and retorts saying that he thought that he said he does not know the way. Mr. 3 appears (although having to jog Luffy's memory a bit for him to remember the former  Baroque Works Officer Agent), and says that he will help them to get to the next floor, as part of his plan to escape from Impel Down.

Meanwhile, at the Level where Ace is being held, we finally see  Jinbe talking with Ace about how his real pain is laying inside his heart, which is bursting to deal out justice to prevent the upcoming war between the  World Government and Whitebeard, and he says that he would willingly give up his title as  Warlord of the Sea and even his own life to stop this fighting. It seems that Ace and Jinbe have known each other for a long time due to his conversation about Whitebeard. Meanwhile, Luffy, Buggy, and Mr. 3 are running away from, and sometimes attacking at a distance,  Manticores. Finally, they meet the boss of the floor, the  Sphinx, a feathered lion which says a bunch of ramen types like a parrot. While Luffy is fighting against the Sphinx, Mr. 3 (who multipleÂ  Doru clones to trick the Floor Boss) and Buggy team up to get out of Impel Down using Luffy as bait. Unfortunately for them, as they are making their escape, the Sphinx smashes the floor to pieces while trying to find the real Mr. 3 (with Luffy egging him on no less), leading everyone down to Level 3.

The guards reach the area after the trio have fallen through, wondering what Luffy could be after. Before they can ponder any further, the escaped prisoners gang up on them, and with the Sphinx now gone, start to run wild, thanking Buggy for their freedom. As the guards go to deal with them, security gets news that they know that Luffy's after Ace, realizing that the two of them are related and that the purpose of Luffy's invasion was to rescue Ace. Quickly, the guards go to inform Magellan just as this news quickly reaches the ears of  Sengoku, frustrating him further while Garp however is more amused by the whole situation. Sengoku goes on to explain that only one pirate named  Shiki (dubbed the flying pirate) was successful in escaping Impel Down, but twenty years since then, no one has managed this feat again. He goes on to scold Garp about it being his grandson who may tarnish the record, as well  Kuma's failure to kill the  Straw Hats (though Garp realized that was a lie right off the bat) and expressing his temptation to let Garp take all the responsibility for his family's actions but cannot due to his reputation. Garp, through all the ranting, simply laughs it off.

#### Starvation Hell: An Old Friend and a New Enemy[]

Meanwhile, Luffy, Buggy, and Mr. 3 have landed in Level 3, which Luffy realizes is much hotter than the previous floors. Mr. 3 however points out the nature of the level, the prisoners in the cells who look starved and emaciated were once people who held a bounty of 50,000,000 and over. However, in this level, there's very little food or water given to them, and they are made to suffer the heat from the bottom floor until they are near death, thus earning the level the title of  Starvation Hell. As the three try to figure a way out of the level and squabble with Luffy on helping him, the security on the level spring a net made of Seastone from under them, hoisting the trio into the air. The guards quickly gather under the bunch, headed by the Chief Guard and Commander of the Blugori,  Saldeath, who prepares to secure them while mentioning the four Jailer Beasts below should they have continued. Before the guards can do so however, the Sphinx, which was also caught in the net, suddenly wakes up, swings around in the net, and eventually breaks it, freeing Luffy, Buggy, and Mr. 3 in the process.

Luffy quickly takes advantage of the situation and runs for it, though the Blugori set after him, only to be felled by Luffy's . He notices Buggy and Mr. 3 climbing the net onto a rafter of the level. The two mock Luffy but he just shouts his thanks for their help much to their bewilderment. Saldeath rallies his security force to go after Luffy forcing him to fight a few until the Sphinx recovers and comes after him as well. Seeing this, Luffy hops across the guard's heads and runs down the hall with security forces in pursuit. Buggy and Mr. 3 take their time to rest for the moment as they try to figure out a way back to Level 2. The two suddenly hear singing coming from a cell whose voice Mr. 3 recognizes. The two follow it leading to a cell containing none other than  Bon Kurei who is doing ballet with the prisoners in his cell (though they collapse shortly after). As he spins, he does a double take once he sees Mr. 3 who asks Buggy if they could not let him out, while Buggy himself is shocked at Bon Kurei's appearance asking, "what strange creature is this?"

Topside of the prison, the Marines have mobilized and prepare to enter Impel Down to capture Luffy. Before they can enter, they are stopped by the Chief Guard  Sadi who implores them to stay outside to fortify the entrance since they do not have any knowledge of the structure of the prison. She reminds them that the pride of Impel Down is at stake so she and the staff inside will handle it. Sadi proceeds to raise the drawbridges of the prison keeping anyone from getting in or out. All the while, a  giant koala peeping out from the prison's entrance gets the attention of the Marines.

Back inside, Hancock's group have finally reached Ace's cell, allowing the Warlord to meet Luffy's brother face to face. As the two talk, the prisoners of the floor begin to leer and make cat calls toward her. This drives on the nerves of Magellan until he suddenly unveils the full extent of his  Devil Fruit powers, literally dripping himself with poison and forming a hydra from the globs. One of the prisoners tries to calm him down, to which Magellan responds by covering the prisoner with poison. Magellan reminds the prisoners that he can and will kill them anytime if they get out of line. Hancock then concludes her business of delivering the news to Ace that Luffy has come to rescue him, much to his surprise, by using Magellan as a distraction.

Meanwhile, Luffy is trying to find his way to Level 4 on his own. He runs into guards that fire Seastone nets his way. He manages to dodge them but is suddenly pinned down by the Sphinx. Before the beast can bite into him, a voice catches its attention. The person apparently being  Zoro, who proceeds to beat up the Sphinx with his kicks. Luffy however realizes that that's not Zoro's fighting style before the person changes into Bon Kurei, much to Luffy's joy (after some initial disappointment that it wasn't his swordsman). The two team up to beat the guards and take down the Sphinx before tearfully weeping and hugging at being reunited. As Saldeath prepares to send his remaining Blugori after them, Bon Kurei happily agrees to help Luffy reach Level 5 since he wishes to meet someone on that level as well.

The Marines identify Buggy, Mr. 3 (whose real name is Galdino) and Bon Kurei (real name Bentham) as the ones aiding Luffy, also noticing that Luffy and Bon Kurei are heading for Level 4 after defeating the Blugori. A few inmates, who managed to get their hands on a black Den Den Mushi, comment on their progress though agree in the end that they'll be captured. Meanwhile in the Chief Warden's office, Magellan has just recently received this news along with Sadi and three of the Jailer Beasts. The fourth one, Minotaurus, who looks like his namesake but not as intimidating, just happens to confront Luffy and Bon Kurei on Level 3. It smacks Bon Kurei into a wall in an instant before the two can react and does the same to Luffy, despite the latter managing to dodge its first blow. Bon recovers and saves Luffy before Minotaurus can strike again, but is quickly pinned down. Luffy enters  and hits it with a , knocking it back up the level. After which, Luffy and Bon locate the entrance to  Level 4: Blazing Hell, which they notice has hot air and smoke billowing out of it.

Bon Kurei explains that the heat is from a boiling kettle filled with blood and flames. He also mentions to watch where they jump otherwise the two will "be getting more than a couple of burns" if they are not careful. Luffy asks about the person who Bon is trying to meet which Bon answers is the queen of  Kamabakka Kingdom and idol of  Okama,  Emporio "Iva" Ivankov, who was supposedly captured and sent to Impel Down. Bon states if that's the case, he will try to rescue him. Their talk is suddenly interrupted by something coming their way, which happens to be Buggy, and Mr. 3 being chased by the recovered Minotaurus, who landed near their hiding place after Luffy sent it flying. Luffy and Bon rejoin them, causing all four to be pursued. Buggy mentions to Luffy the  Buggy Balls he used back in  Orange Town (which Luffy does not remember to Buggy's chagrin), only he's now condensed it small enough to hide on his person, renaming it the . He throws it at the Minotaurus where it explodes on contact in its face, greatly wounding it though not knocking it out. Luffy quickly asks Mr. 3 to fit his arm with wax like he did on  Little Garden, despite, given the setting, that it'll quickly melt in three seconds. Bon buys them time by hitting the Jailer Beast with a spinning kick knocking it down. Mr. 3 quickly fits Luffy with a Candle Lock on his arm and Luffy finishes Minotaurus with . The four celebrate their victory at downing a Jailer Beast before pressing onward. Meanwhile, Ace begs to Luffy not to come, while the rest of Impel Down's forces assemble on Level 4.

Outside, Boa Hancock and Momonga have left the prison and are heading back to their Marine ship via a ferry. Twenty-nine hours remain before Ace's execution. As she looks on at the prison, Hancock prays for Luffy's safety. The two eventually reach the ship where Momonga receives urgent news,  Kaidou, one of the  Four Emperors, took off to try and take down Whitebeard, but  Shanks intercepted him and the two are currently in a dispute. This news unnerves Momonga as he knows what could happen if two Emperors fight, not to mention the coming threat of Whitebeard on top of everything. He quickly has his ship sail off for  Marineford.

Back inside the prison, Buggy and Mr. 3 get into an argument with Luffy and Bon over escaping rather than heading further into Impel Down. Before they can continue however, part of the floor they are on breaks off (due to the strength of their attacks which causes the four to get into an argument over whose was more powerful) and sends them plummeting to Level 4.

#### Blazing Hell: Defeat at the Hands of Desperation[]

On Level 4 in an area known as the "Lake of Blood", inmates are forced into the cauldron Bon previously described while a few are made to bring firewood to keep it heated. One prisoner tries to escape but runs right into  Daz Bonez who headbutts him into the cauldron. Meanwhile in a passageway that connects Levels 3 and 4, Magellan has gathered the guards and Impel Down staff to intercept Luffy's group. It's here we're introduced to the rest of the Jailer Beasts:  Minorhinoceros, Minokoala, and  Minozebra (all of whom, like Minotarus, do not look as threatening as their name suggests) who Sadi is in charge of commenting that they're growing restless and thirsting for blood.

One of the guards reports Luffy having reached Level 4 and avoided the pool by the debris he and his group fell on. He also reports Minotaurus' defeat which shocks Sadi. Upon hearing this Magellan stations Hannyabal at the Level 3 stairs and Sadi at the Level 5 entrance to keep the group from proceeding or heading back, while Magellan sends the rest of his guards to pursue the group, giving them permission to kill them (though Sadi wants them kept alive for torture purposes). Meanwhile Luffy's group are on a bridge near the Lake of Blood. Luffy suddenly heads in another direction from the group which Bon realizes is where the kitchen is, undoubtedly the smell of which has attracted Luffy. Guards spot him and rush his way, but Luffy easily takes care of them. In the sidelines, Mr. 3 talks to Buggy noticing the guard's formation and fearing that they'll be locked on the level with Impel Down's "All Stars".

Sure enough, just as Luffy and Bon KureiÂ are heading towardsÂ the kitchen, Magellan suddenlyÂ falls from above, with powers already activated and ready to fight. Seeing this, the guards quickly try to get out of the way begging Magellan to wait before he fights so as not to get swept up in his poison. Luffy notices this but moans at not being able to get any food as he faces down the Chief Warden. Bon yells at Luffy not to fight him, telling him of his poison powers and that they should forget the food and escape. But Magellan counters telling them that he has the guards and staff blocking the exits, effectively trapping the group on the level, just as Mr. 3 predicted. He also reveals he intends to make Luffy tell him how he got in Impel Down. Luffy, knowing Hancock will be in trouble if that happens, yells he will not tell even if he dies. Thus, the fighting begins with Magellan using his poison  and sending it after the two, forcing Luffy and Bon to run away while a few lingering guards are caught in the wave. Seeing this, Bon tells Luffy that the poison attacks the nervous system and induces pain until it eventually kills the unfortunate victim, as the guards clearly show and beg for antidotes. Magellan scolds the guards not to get into his combat range, while Luffy jumps off the bridge and grabs onto a hanging spike platform, swinging himself onto it, and burning himself in the process since he swung over flames. However, he does manage to destroy one of the Hydras who plunges into the Lake of Blood, while the rest are out of range to attack Luffy.

Magellan counters this however by blowing a poison bubble toward Luffy called  that explodes once it reaches the platform. Luffy manages to jump to another one to avoid the explosion, but gas suddenly appears from it. The guards quickly put on masks, commenting that it's the sneezing tear gas, causing Luffy's (and the unfortunate inmates on the level) eyes to water and sneeze uncontrollably. Magellan has the  stretch to Luffy's location to which he "swims" to the Straw Hat through it, dubbing the move . The Chief Warden takes off his horns, fits them over his hands and tries to stab at Luffy with them. The horns are also coated with poison, evident when Luffy dodges a strike and sees the rocks it hits instantly melt (similar to  Crocodile's poison hook). Magellan strikes again but Luffy redirects the attack with his foot onto the platform causing it to break and sending him falling toward the flames. Though Luffy saves himself by using his  to knock himself back onto the main bridge.

Throughout this, Bon has hidden himself, convinced that Luffy cannot win, as Magellan is known to silence even the most ultimate of prisoners. With a heavy heart, he forces himself to run away, asking Luffy to forgive him. Meanwhile, Buggy and Mr. 3 argue over trying to escape due to the number of guards below and Magellan distracted. Mr. 3, however, manages to convince Buggy that they do not know anything about Hannyabal and might be able to take him on. With that they make their way to the Level 3 entrance. Back to Luffy, who finds himself fatigued as Magellan stands over him, asks him if he still wants to continue fighting. Luffy, however, states his determination on saving his brother and that if he was going to lose since Magellan is made of poison and he can't touch him, then he will just have to sacrifice his arms so he can win. Luffy instantly activates  and proceeds to hit Magellan head on with a , hurting the Chief Warden but at the same time getting poison on his hands.

Over at the Level 3 tunnel, Hannyabal is expressing his annoyance at Mr. 3 and Buggy who lay on the floor with bumps and bruises all over them. Apparently beaten quickly when trying to fight against the Vice Warden. Hannyabal, however, is more annoyed with the fact that he was willing to let them pass but they instead chose to fight against him (though a few of the guards were injured in the process). The guards report their capture to the Monitor Room. Meanwhile, Bon Kurei continues to run, sobbing to himself as he knocks out any guards in his way. Back to Luffy and the Chief Warden, Magellan is surprised he actually took a hit from Luffy. However, Luffy is worse off as the poison corrodes his hands. Regardless, he strikes at the Chief Warden with a , just as the Chief Warden puffs up and shoots out multiple . Luffy dodges and goes for a , however Magellan counters with his . Nullifying the attack and dripping Luffy with more poison. Luffy tries to get some distance, but Magellan breathes out a mist into air which the Chief Warden calls , making Luffy's vision hazy and causing him to lose his hearing.

Magellan states that not even Luffy's hands will respond to him as the cloud will eventually rob him of everything, to which Luffy starts to double over. On Level 6, Ace demands to know what's happening upstairs but the guards tell him nothing. Luffy tries to attack Magellan again, but the attack does not even come close to hitting the Chief Warden as the poison continues to affect him. Still, Magellan is astonished by his mental strength. Luffy tries again, but kicks into the flames of the bridge burning himself once more. Magellan finally decides to end it and completely covers Luffy with his . Luffy is defeated, covered from head to toe in poison as it melts away at him. Magellan cites it as a punishment for invading Impel Down and explaining that in 24 hours, Luffy will go to the real hell (i.e., the poison will kill him in that time). Magellan orders the guards to throw Luffy into Level 5 despite the fact that he will die anyway, while Luffy weakly calls out Ace's name.

Magellan suddenly receives news that something has happened at the Level 3 entrance.

#### Freezing Hell: A Friend's True Loyalty Shines[]

On  Level 5: Freezing Hell, a floor which is covered completely in ice so much so that prisoners freeze to death and the food so frozen it's inedible, Luffy is carried in by the guards. One of the prisoners calls out to Luffy to try and find out his bounty, but notices he took the "poison baptism" already. Back on Level 4, Magellan finds all the guards knocked out and the Level 3 door open. After waking up Hannyabal, he explains that Bon Kurei plowed through and headed back up to Level 3. Magellan orders the guards to capture him and has the Jailer Beasts disperse, ordering the others to clean everything up as he goes to his sealed place (the bathroom). When asked what to do with the captured Buggy and Mr. 3, he leaves Hannyabal to do as he wishes to them. Hannyabal tells the guards to go help capture Bon Kurei which they comply. However, once they leave, Hannyabal suddenly changes into Bon Kurei himself, having somehow taken his place. He tells Buggy and Mr. 3 they have to hurry to save Luffy. The two of course are wary of the idea and ask why Bon would go back after all the trouble of escaping. Bon answers that Luffy is a friend and that's all the reason he needs.

He is later seen consulting a medical team (as Hannyabal) somewhere within Impel Down, urging them to whip up an antidote that will cure Luffy of Magellan's poison. Unfortunately, they informed him that no one before Luffy has endured Magellan's Doku Doku No Mi powers to the extent that Luffy had, and with more than one type of poison now surging through his veins at the moment, attempting to treat him may only result in an even earlier demise. With his hope to find an antidote crushed, Bon retreats to Buggy and Mr. 3, who tells him that Luffy really has no hope for survival and that it would take something miraculous if he were to survive the sentence Magellan gave him. This, however, made Bon remember about Iva, the person that he also wishes to meet (and save) down in Level 5. He proceeds to head down to said level with his two cohorts and, as he was still assuming Hannyabal's form, was able to gain access to the keys meant for the cells in Level 5. Though from the list of prisoners, he finds that Iva's name has been scratched off. When asked why, the guards state that he disappeared presumably snatched away by some unknown figure that has been doing so to other prisoners on the level which they dub as "demoning away" (interestingly said prisoners were on the verge of freezing to death when they disappeared).

Together, the trio entered the level unfortunately without their winter gear as Hannyabal has a reputation of walking around the level in his regular clothes without freezing and prisoners are forced to wear their regular prison garments as well. They are shortly confronted by wolves, which were originally stationed in Level 2 but had to be placed on this level for their voracious appetites. Mr. 3 and Buggy quickly run off no sooner than they see them, leaving Bon to fend for himself.

Meanwhile in one of the prison cells, prisoners watch as Luffy slowly suffers from the poison. Surprisingly, Luffy is still able to move determined to save Ace, but is also very weakened.  One of the prisoners tries to get him to give in, citing that it's every man for himself in Impel Down and that friendship has no meaning when it comes to survival. No sooner than he sprouts this, Bon suddenly appears, wounded from his encounter with the wolves but still standing. He apologizes to Luffy for running off during his bout with Magellan and proceeds to get him out of the cell leaving the keys behind for the other prisoners.

Bon goes around the level asking about Iva, and after a few dead ends, one prisoner tells him that he saw Iva head into the woods where Magellan's old office was. Bon heads that way dragging Luffy along, but once he's out of earshot another prisoner in the same cell mentions wolves roaming the forest, which gets a chuckle from the one who gave Bon the information, obviously having withheld this fact from the Okama. In the forest, Bon soldiers on, despite his body taking a beating from the cold, but determined not to let Luffy die. Wolves find and surround the two prompting Bon to fight them off the best he can, but there are too many and a few manage to bite him. Luffy wakes up, bites one of the wolves, then yells for them to get away. The wolves are instantly struck by his  Haki and run away while Luffy faints. Bon is amazed at the feat Luffy just performed, but succumbs to his wounds and faints as well. However, as both men lose consciousness, a  figure in an orange and white suit and hairstyle find them while a caption comes up informing that 26 hours remain until Ace's execution.

#### Newkama Land: New Allies in Unlikely Places[]

It is revealed that Hannyabal is tied up and locked in the weapon storage room having been seduced and tricked by Bon Kurei posing as  Nami. Meanwhile, Saldeath and Sadi are clearing up everything on Level 3 and are also looking for Bon Kurei whom they believe is still on Level 3. Later, Bon Kurei is seen waking up in a strange place where everyone is partying and drinking. There, everyone welcomes him and tells him he's still inside Impel Down despite the paradise-like atmosphere. The stranger who saved both Luffy and Bon Kurei in the forest appears, introducing herself as Inazuma, and also remarks that Bon has slept for over ten hours. The room suddenly darkens as the stage in the front of the room slowly reveals none other than the former "Queen" of the Kamabakka Kingdom, Emporio Ivankov. He reveals that Bon Kurei is in the Prisoner's Paradise which is accessed through the sewers of Impel Down, 'through the road that cannot exist' and also reveals that the prisoners in the past who have supposedly been 'demoned away' actually escaped into this prisoner's paradise in which he calls  Newkama Land.

Suddenly, a  man steps up from the crowd and threatens Ivankov with a bazooka claiming that his father who was a king who traveled to the Kamabakka Kingdom and came back as an Okama which tore their kingdom apart. He proceeds to fire the bazooka in which Ivankov deflects the missile by winking, striking the man instead. He goes on to demonstrate his power by changing the man into a woman in which he/she runs out of the room in embarrassment. After seeing his powers, Bon Kurei begs Iva to save Luffy. Ivankov tells Bon that he was healed because Luffy begged them to help him despite being at death's door from Magellan's poison. He further tells Bon Kurei that Luffy has been undergoing medical treatment for hours which happened to be pretty rough and has been screaming nonstop in a locked cave. He also remarks that he still has two days left of treatment with 16 hours before Ace's execution.

The story shifts back a bit to the start of Luffy's treatment which has him chained to a table and his shirt and shoesÂ removed. Emporio tells Luffy that he will take ten years from Luffy's life in the effort to save him, though warns the possibility of Luffy surviving are very slim and that it all rests entirely on his willpower. He injects Luffy with hormones causing him to yell out in agony. Ten hours have passed since, with no change so far, and Bon is extremely worried about Luffy's condition. Ivankov explains that the combination of willpower and hormones create a vital force, basically using his power to boost the immune system so it can fight against the poison. Though doing so destroys and regenerates cells which is the cause of Luffy's pain, hence the willpower part. If Luffy can hold out until then, his life will be saved. Iva allows Bon to see how Luffy's doing through a peephole into the locked room. It only takes a glance however to get Bon into a panic and beg Iva to help him. Ivankov slaps Bon to calm him down and explains that he already is saving Luffy.

Iva explains that despite the title of being a "miracle worker", he does not see himself as such even when helping nations and that he never saved the life of anyone that purely relies on the help of others. To him, miracles are given to those that are willing to carry on and are not something to be taken lightly, a statement which shocks Bon. Iva goes on to explain that he has the power of the  Horu Horu no Mi granting him the ability to shape anyone from within as he sees fit, citing that the people on the level were either men or women once due to him. Bon still in denial if the place really exists which Iva convinces him it is after hitting him with a . It turns out there are many entrances to Newkama Land on all levels of Impel Down which a few prisoners just happen to stumble into. What's more, they also have monitoring equipment to see any level of the prison and keep up with news on the outside via discarded newspapers. It was through the former that they found out about Luffy breaking into the prison which they thoroughly enjoyed from the monitors. Bon questions how they can have so much space, which is answered that the  original founder, who had a  "tunneling" Devil Fruit, created it in between Levels 5 and 6. This news shocks Bon since he did not know Level 6 existed, but Iva explains that it's due to sealing away prisoners that have either done something severe that the World Government had to cover up or simply inconvenienced them.

Ivankov mentions that there was once another Head Jailer known as " Shiryu of the Rain" who was even more dangerous than Magellan himself. Together the two made Impel Down near impenetrable, however Shiryu killed prisoners for no reason other than his own pleasure. Thus, he was labeled a menace and was locked away on Level 6. Iva lists off a few other names of prisoners who the World Government have covered up, not even allowed to be mentioned in newspapers. He also mentions Crocodile, Jinbe, and of course Ace and his relation to Luffy. However, Iva notes that it is now midnight meaning the date of Ace's execution is at hand and since Luffy's treatment will take another two days it'll be too late by then to save him. This news disheartens Bon who decides to stay with Luffy for the rest of the treatment. Upon hearing Luffy's continued screaming, Bon starts to shout out encouragements to him. This touches the others, and they join him.

On the top levels, Sadi, her Jailer Beasts, and the rest of the staff have no luck in finding Bon. Eventually they report to Magellan that he has completely vanished while a few guards find the tied up Hannayabal. On Level 6, Jinbe doubts the information that Hancock had relayed to Ace, but Ace knows it's real since he knows Luffy better than anyone. Eight hours pass through all of this, and morning eventually arrives. Domino comes to remind Magellan that it is time to transport Ace. Back in Newkama Land, Luffy abruptly stops screaming which worries Iva. Blood suddenly seeps from the cave, prompting Bon and the others to take it as a sign he did not make it. Just as they start to mourn, the door to the room is suddenly pounded against. This is followed by Luffy yelling out for food, much to the joy of Bon and the others on the level as well as the astonishment of Iva who exclaims it has not even been a day since the procedure began.

The residents of Newkama Land proceed bring Luffy some food to feed his appetite, so much so that it nearly depletes their provisions. After about a half hour, Luffy is eventually full enough that he comes out of the room somewhat healed after transferring the food to his muscles. The "Candies" (what Iva calls the people of Newkama Land) hoist him into the air in celebration and awe over his recovery in only 20 hours, though Iva thinks to himself that the feat was "far beyond a miracle". Luffy notices Bon is okay as well, however Bon suddenly collapses in the midst of his joy, which Iva explains is due to exhaustion from cheering on Luffy during his suffering. Upon hearing this, Luffy bows to Bon thanking him and calming him in his debt. Inazuma returns Luffy's clothes and straw hat but mentions that he has not fully recovered yet and should take a day to rest. But Luffy refuses knowing he does not have much time before Ace is shipped off. Just as he asks the others to watch Bon he suddenly collapses, a sign of his fatigue. Luffy checks the  Vivre Card and sees it pointing downward. Luffy asks Iva if he plans to escape, revealing it's the reason Bon was looking for him in the first place. Iva is flattered by this, but mentions the time is not right, only planning to leave once the revolutionary  Dragon acts, as doing so any sooner will just get him recaptured. Upon the mention of Dragon, Luffy points him out to be his father. Iva, at first, calmly takes the news without much notice, but reacts in shock once it sinks in.

The Okama queen is in disbelief at first, but upon asking where Luffy hails from and finding out he's from  East Blue, Iva realizes Luffy is telling the truth, especially after displaying his incredible willpower. A flashback shows us that Iva was actually part of Dragon's  Revolutionary Army. One day, he notices that no matter where Dragon was, he would face and stare off in the same direction, which Iva assumes is an animal instinct of missing his homeland. However, Dragon refuses to answer on if this was true or if he had any family left behind and the matter was quickly dropped. After this startling realization, Iva has Inazuma find out Ace's departure time, since if the Vivre Card is still pointing downward, it means Ace has not been moved yet. The reason for the sudden change in attitude being that Iva suddenly feels he has a responsibility to Luffy as well as Ace since he thinks both of them are Dragon's sons, something he tells Luffy, revealing his relationship with his father. Iva rallies the others to prepare to bust out Ace. Luffy is even more pumped up to get going, but suddenly falls over. Iva checks his pulse and determines that it is strong, so he injects Luffy with  that boost his adrenaline. He tells Luffy that for the rest of the day, he will be able to ignore his fatigue, but the full brunt of the effects will kick in afterward.

Back on Level 5, Hannyabal is informed of Bon's entry into the level with Buggy and Mr. 3. However, they only find Hannyabal's bloodied headdress and assume the trio was eaten by the wolves. In a lift leading to Level 6, Domino scolds Magellan for his delay and informs him that they will hand Ace over to the transport at 9 AM sharp and that failure for such an important assignment will mean having a huge stain on their record. At the entrance topside,  Onigumo and his Marine squad wait outside for the transfer. He reminds the Marines of their mission, revealing that five Marine ships are on hand along with five other Vice Admirals, and for everyone not to let their guard down for a second. Back on Level 5, Luffy, Iva and Inazuma charge out of Newkama Land opting to not worry about being seen and rush through anything that comes their way. The wolves give chase to them, but the trio easily takes them out, while the prisoners on the level are surprised to see Iva as they believed he was dead. They reach the entrance to  Level 6: Eternal Hell and unlock the door to press on. In the Monitor Room, the guards spot them heading for Level 6, shocked that the intruders are people whom they thought were dead, even pointing out that Inazuma is also a revolutionary. One of the guards mentions that the trio will run straight into Magellan and Domino as they are headed to Level 6 as well. Hannyabal, suddenly getting very serious, orders the traps to be activated and the guards on the level to prepare for combat in the hope of stalling them until Sadi and the Jailer Beasts reach the level. As Luffy charges down the steps to Eternal Hell, Magellan is already at Ace's cell preparing to take Ace to his execution.

#### Eternal Hell: To the Marine Headquarters![]

Luffy's group plows through anyone and anything in their path until they reach Level 6. Luffy instantly screams out for Ace, but once they reach the cell, they find him gone with only Jinbe remaining. The  Fish-Man realizes who Luffy is and warns him that Ace has already been taken though Luffy can still catch him. Luffy, Iva and Inazuma make for the lift out of the level but when Iva tries the controls to bring the lift down, he finds it locked. Luffy opts to just climb out of the level, but notices a spike trap at the top of the lift which comes crashing down and would have hit him had he not jump back. Iva quickly realizes their actions are being monitored from the Den Den Mushis, so of course security would have barred their way. The group heads back to the Level 5 entrance, but a gate crashes down, stopping them and trapping them on the level. Furthermore, sleeping gas is flooded into the level which Iva realizes is a means to hold them until the Impel Down security arrive on the level. Indeed, in the Monitor Room, this is reported to Hannyabal who reports to Magellan on Level 1 as he holds down Ace, having put up a struggle once he heard what was happening. The Chief Warden is surprised that Luffy survived his poisoning. Back on Level 6, the inmates begin to complain about the incoming gas, demanding the trio do something about it. Inazuma complies, turning his hands into scissors then cuts up the floor and wraps it around the vents to keep the gas from getting through.

Iva reveals to the astonished group that Inazuma ate the  Choki Choki no Mi and thus can cut anything as if it were paper. Luffy complains that they cannot get through if the stairways are blocked, but Inazuma counters that despite the simplicity of Impel Down staff's plan it was enough to capture them and there is now no escape. Iva manages to disable the monitor Den Den Mushis, but notes it's too late to save Ace, as he is already topside being transferred to the Marines. Luffy's Vivre Card moving away from the prison also proves Iva's words. Despite this, Luffy states that if Ace is heading to  Marine Headquarters, then so will he. Iva tries to talk him out of it, but Luffy counters saying that if he did not, he'd regret it for the rest of his life. Upon seeing Luffy's face, Iva compares it to facing Dragon. Suddenly a voice calls out to Luffy, offering to create a hole to get the group out of Level 6. However, Luffy knows the voice all too well, as it belongs to none other than Crocodile.

Crocodile had at first lost interest in the outside world, but hearing that Whitebeard was going to war with the Marines has caused him to reconsider as it is a perfect chance to take down the legendary pirate. Luffy, however, wants nothing to do with him, the  Arabasta incident still fresh in his mind. Iva on the other hand, suggests freeing him, much to Luffy's shock, though reveals that he has long since known the former Warlord of the Sea as far back as when he was a rookie and should Crocodile get out of line, he will take care of him himself since he knows of Crocodile's weakness. Iva states he is only willing to free him if Crocodile helps out (much to Crocodile's chagrin). Jinbe suddenly speaks out, begging to help, as he wants to save Ace as badly as Luffy, even willing to die "a glorious death" in doing so. Noting this, Luffy agrees to his wishes. Inazuma frees Crocodile and Jinbe of their chains, and the five prepare to break out of Impel Down.

The security force reaches Level 6 with gas masks on, prepared to fight against the Devil Fruit users. However, once they get past the gate, they find a spiral shaped stairway leading to a hole in the ceiling. Shiryu calls out to the guards informing them (between mocking) that the trio has released Crocodile and Jinbe, and with their help have escaped the level. Shiryu tells the guards to go tell Magellan that he'd be willing to help him. In the Monitor Room, news of this new development has reached Hannyabal, who decides to deal with things himself and have all the Impel Down forces meet on Level 4. Back on Level 5, Iva and Inazuma have gathered the residents of Newkama Land. They tell them to cause a riot throughout all of Impel Down, grabbing keys and unlocking cages as they go to keep the security forces occupied. Iva calls out for Luffy to proceed only to be informed by Inazuma that he, along with Crocodile and Jinbe, have already pressed on. Iva shrugs this off and tells the others to follow after him. Bon Kurei is also among the group, having been injected with Tension Hormones (though they work a little too well since he cannot stop spinning).

In a stairway leading to Level 4 from Level 5, Luffy, Crocodile and Jinbe rush on. The latter mentions that the execution is set for 3 PM and that Whitebeard could make his move at any point while Ace is on the ocean. Luffy is content on the premise that Ace will not be executed before he is scheduled to. Crocodile gets ahead of the two and dries up the entrance to Level 4, turning it to sand, only to find the security on that level are waiting for them. This does not stop the trio though and they attack at full force. Crocodile uses his  Barchan ability, Luffy uses his  and Jinbe uses his  Fish-Man Karate (which is so powerful he does not even need to touch the guards to knock them back). It becomes evident to the guards that they cannot beat the trio.

On Level 2, Buggy and Mr. 3, running for twenty hours since the wolf incident, are hiding themselves in a camouflaged wax cell. Mr. 3 notices some commotion going on, which the duo realize is their best chance to escape. Buggy meets with a few inmates, asking if they are all set. It is revealed that the prisoners have keys made of wax to unlock the cells.

The Monitor Room contacts Hannyabal informing him of strange people creeping around on Level 2. The security on that level is headed for Level 4 when the Monitor Room tries to warn them of what's going on, but it's too late. The prisoners have used the wax keys to unlock all the cell doors freeing the inmates. Buggy and Mr. 3 reveal their plan to start another riot in hopes of using it as an escape, thinking Luffy and Bon are long since dead. With that, they initiate their plan and a riot on Level 2 commences. On Level 4, Crocodile throws some keys into a cell asking a certain inmate if he would like to escape with him. This person is none other than Mr. 1, who agrees, commenting he was getting bored of Impel Down.

Hannyabal continues to receive distressing news, this time of Iva's army rampaging through the prison and taking out anyone in their way. Luffy meets up with Bon as well as Mr. 1. Luffy does not recognize the latter, so Bon tells him of Mr. 1's defeat against Zoro. Luffy just shrugs it off since he has never met him until now. Hannyabal is in a panic as the Monitor Room keeps getting requests for backup for Levels 4 and 2, as the group charge on with no indication of stopping. As they do, Luffy yells to everyone that it's time to head for Marine Headquarters.

#### An Unexpected Visitor: Blackbeard Arrives at Impel Down![]

Ace, meanwhile, is now on the sea aboard Onigumo's ship, chained to a chair. The Vice Admiral tells him to get a view of the sky while he can before calling Marineford to start preparations to the open the gate. At Marine Headquarters, a Marine frantically reports to Sengoku that  Blackbeard has suddenly gone missing, which is bad as it's only five hours away from Ace's execution. Furthermore, a Marine ship with no authorization has suddenly entered Impel Down. At the Impel Down entrance, Blackbeard and  his crew have arrived. When the guards try to stop them, Blackbeard sucks them up into his  darkness then spits them out at the Marines who try to come at the crew from behind.

This new development is quickly broadcasted to the Monitor Room, which causes Hannyabal to freak out more than he already was. With Luffy's group on Level 4, a riot led by Buggy and Mr. 3 on the Level 2 and Blackbeard at the entrance, his panic seems justified especially since he is in charge of the prison at the moment. Suddenly, Magellan calls over the Den Den Mushi, having come back inside Impel Down and poisoned most of the prisoners on Level 2, as well as sealing all the exits, much to Buggy and Mr. 3's dismay. Magellan however decides to send all his forces to Level 4 as a last-ditch effort since he cannot call reinforcements and hopes the staff will hold out until he gets there. This greatly improves Hannyabal's morale, who cheers for the warden much to the confusion of his troops. Magellan also decides to take the dangerous risk of freeing Shiryu.

On Level 6, Shiryu has been released from his cell, as per Magellan's orders, though the Chief Warden reminds his former co-worker over the Den Den Mushi that he is on a postponed sentence and that he will get no more chances. Magellan closes the call stating that he will leave Blackbeard to Shiryu. The guards on the level give him his sword which Shiryu promptly uses to slice through them as his first course of action, apologizing afterwards. On Level 4, Luffy's group continues to rampage defeating the guards, gaining keys, and freeing more prisoners to help them in their breakout. Saldeath and his Blugori appear on the scene, but Iva, using his face growth hormones and  for a wider attack range, quickly takes them out. The Okama Queen tells Luffy to leave the guards to them and keep going, which Luffy obliges. However, Sadi and her Jailer Beasts arrive and quickly begin taking out most of the group with nothing seemingly able to affect them. Just as all seems lost, Luffy, Jinbe and Crocodile rush forward and hit them with strong attacks, knocking out the Jailer Beasts in one hit much to the horror of Sadi and the shock of the guards.

On Level 1, the guards raise the drawbridge in hope of stopping Blackbeard's crew though said pirates seem to be easily pressing onward despite the attacks. Shiryu appears on the scene and confronts Blackbeard. Before anything happens though, we suddenly shift back to Level 4 where Luffy's group continue to battle the guards as they try to press on. Sadi, however, confronts the group herself and shows that she has strength of her own by taking out a few of the prisoners with her whip, breaking off a piece of the bridge over the Lake of Blood in the process. Luffy starts to attack her himself, but Iva grabs and throws him over Sadi, reminding Luffy that he needs to continue on. Iva, now suddenly transformed into a female, proceeds to do battle with the Head Jailer (much to Luffy's confusion since he does not know the woman is Iva). Inazuma goes to lead Luffy to the exit of the level but is stopped by Hannyabal, now wielding a Naginata (a double-bladed staff) and taking out a few of the prisoners. Thousands of jailers are with him all wielding bazookas and blocking the entrance to Level 3. Hannyabal declares a death sentence on Luffy as the guards cheer and make music for him to prepare an attack of his called  where he spins the Naginata until it catches on fire then goes to attack Luffy with it.

Luffy eventually has enough of his foolishness, going into  and hits him with . Surprisingly, Hannyabal, though heavily wounded, gets back up and continues the fight. It's at this point that Magellan arrives on Level 4 though at the far end from where the riot is and will still take a while before he arrives at the fight. Meanwhile, Luffy keeps hitting Hannyabal with a variety of attacks and tries to move on, but the Vice Warden refuses to stay down. His troops begin to worry about him begging him not to push himself so hard. Hannyabal goes into a tirade about how evil pirates are and how they cause fear to the citizens above. He proclaims that Impel Down is a prison to keep evil pirates away from said people and that if it falls it'll plunge the world into darkness. Luffy however counters that Ace is precious to him and for Hannyabal to move out of his way, prompting the Vice Warden to state that "some fools just refuse to listen."

Suddenly, Hannyabal's men are sucked into some darkness, a figure telling him that despite all the talk of justice and evil, there really is no answer to be found. Said figure turns out to be Blackbeard who stomps Hannyabal into the ground, finally knocking him out. This pauses the fighting as he and his crew appear among the group with Luffy instantly remembering Blackbeard from  Jaya. His name suddenly strikes a chord with Luffy who remembers that Ace told him he was looking for someone named Blackbeard and Elder  Nyon mentions someone with the same name capturing Ace, as well as Teach's speech back on Jaya.

With this revelation, Luffy angrily asks he if was indeed Blackbeard which the captain realizes he never told Luffy his name before. Blackbeard mentions that he himself was surprised to find out Luffy was the brother of Ace before asking the Straw Hat Captain if he should be hanging around the prison as Ace's execution draws near. Blackbeard explains he found out about Luffy after he defeated Crocodile and due to the newly created open seat as a Warlord, Blackbeard figured it would be a perfect way to make himself known to the World Government. And what better way than to capture Luffy himself, however Ace of course found out and fought to protect Luffy leading to him being captured. Blackbeard, though, considers this fortunate for Luffy since Ace went in his place. As the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates agree on this, a very angered Luffy charges Blackbeard and hits him with a  knocking him into a wall.

Luffy proclaims he will not let Ace die and starts to attack again, but Blackbeard summons a black whirlpool sucking Luffy toward him and slamming him into the ground. Crocodile is surprised that Luffy actually bled from the attack since he's made of rubber. Before the fight can continue, Jinbe stops Luffy telling him that it is not the time and to think about his top priority also adding that Blackbeard was even able to take down Ace, a  Logia user. This calms Luffy while Blackbeard is surprised at Luffy's strength and his increase in Haki. Crocodile speaks out asking that if Blackbeard is supposed to be a Warlord, then why was he not at Marine Headquarters which Blackbeard answers this is all part of his plan. Crocodile shrugs this off not really caring before the other prisoners announce that Magellan is closing in on the area. One of his poison Hydras manage to hit a few of the prisoners in the back prompting the group to continue on, Iva warning Luffy that if he is poisoned again, he will not survive this time.

As the group make for the Level 3 entrance. Minotaurus suddenly appears and attacks most of the escapees, much to Bon's shock since he thought they already defeated him. Crocodile explains however that it as well as the rest of the Jailer Beasts are " Awakened"  Zoan-types, meaning they're much tougher and faster at recovering. Even the three they've recently downed will be back on their feet as well, but Crocodile is more worried about Magellan than them. Sure enough, Magellan arrives at the bridge, his troops reporting about Blackbeard on the level causing the Chief Warden to wonder how he got past Shiryu. Suddenly an urgent call comes in over the Den Den Mushi revealing the Monitor Room, with their monitors having all been destroyed as well as their communications meaning they cannot contact anyone on the outside.

Before they can go on, they are suddenly stopped by Shiryu not wanting Magellan to come down there. Magellan sends one of his troops to check it out while he laments how everything has gone wrong just by one person sneaking in. On Level 2, Buggy and Mr. 3 along with the inmates on that level continue on, as Blackbeard broke through Magellan's poison blocks on his way down, allowing them to escape. Back with Luffy, he states once more to Blackbeard that he will save Ace. Blackbeard does not doubt him since he does not believe anything is impossible in the world, saying that if Luffy found the  Sky Island before then the  One Piece is out there as well. The Blackbeard Pirates tells them that in a few hours they'll show them a show that'll shake the world. Luffy says nothing as he and his group head for Level 3.

Soon Magellan comes across a tied up Sadi who lost her fight against Iva. Magellan has his troops cut her down just as the Blackbeard Pirates arrive. As Blackbeard introduces himself, Magellan hits him and his crew with his  coating them with poison. As they reel in pain Magellan continues on coming across a bloodied Hannyabal. The Chief Warden compliments him on holding out as long as he did before ordering him not to die, stating that Hannyabal is the only successor that Magellan would ever accept to replace him. Magellan yells out to Luffy that he will not let the Straw Hat escape alive.

#### Fight or Flight: Final Push for Escape[]

Buggy, Mr. 3 and their bunch reach Level 1, continuing the riot from there while Luffy's breakout has reached Level 3. However, Magellan is closing in fast taking out most of the rioters that were escaping with them and quickly reducing their numbers. Sadi recovers, angered over her loss to Iva. She wakes up the Jailer Beasts and sends them to Level 1 via the lift. Back with our heroes, Jinbe tells Luffy that the prison is surrounded by Marine ships which they can use to escape and hopefully reach the execution in time. Four hours remain before the deadline of such. The group reaches the stairway to Level 2, when Iva suddenly stays behind and makes sure all those with them make it in. Magellan arrives not a moment after, prompting Iva to call out to Inazuma who runs ahead, cutting the stairway into pieces and blocking the exit while Iva confronts the Chief Warden. On Level 2, the people from Newkama Land ask Inazuma why he did such an action, but he only tells them to keep moving before praying for Iva's safety. Back on Level 3, Iva changes back to his original form and proceeds to attack Magellan.

Meanwhile, Luffy's group are plowing through Level 2 and dealing with the creatures on the said level when Luffy notices that Magellan is not behind them anymore. Bon informs him of Iva and Inazuma's efforts to stall him which nearly prompts Luffy to turn back. Bon, however, convinces him to keep going and to believe in their power. Meanwhile, Crocodile and Jinbe notice the whole level devoid of prisoners and that their cells have been left open. Back on Level 3, it seems Iva has been hit in the face by Magellan's poison, but he reveals he's faking, having avoided the attack thanks to his heavy makeup. Magellan grows annoyed with his antic, so Iva proceeds to end it with his ultimate attack. On Level 2, Inazuma stands guard in front of the destroyed entrance when something burst into the room. He at first thinks it's Iva but much to his dismay, Magellan appears, wounded but still going. Inazuma proceeds to go on the attack with the cut-up stairs to buy some more time.

On Level 1, Buggy and Mr. 3's squad runs into trouble once more in the form of the Jailer Beasts. Just as they are about to turn back, they run into Crocodile (much to Mr. 3 shock). One of the prisoners suddenly reports that the Jailer Beasts were defeated resulting in the two receiving more shock once they see that Luffy and Jinbe were the ones who defeated them and Luffy asking if they were okay. The Okama army follows with Bon quickly kicking Buggy and Mr. 3 for their earlier abandonment. However, Magellan arrives which Luffy and Bon take a sign that Iva and Inazuma were defeated. Luffy starts to attack but his held back once again by Bon. Jinbe suddenly notices that one of the guards on the walkway speaking into his Den Den Mushi to Magellan who orders him to do something. This throws Jinbe into a panic as he tells Luffy they have to get topside straight away as they have bigger problems than the Chief Warden. Before they can escape, one of Magellan's  comes at them. Mr. 3 manages to block the attack with a . He tells Luffy he's only doing it as not to be placed in his debt and that he should get out while he can as he holds off Magellan.

Magellan recognizes the wall made of wax which Mr. 3 gloats is tough as steel and enough to block his attacks. Even Crocodile is impressed as is Luffy. Luffy has Jinbe go on ahead to secure a ship while he stays with Mr. 3 to hold off Magellan so he will not attack while they are trying to secure a boat. He also mentions he has an idea on how to fight the Chief Warden. Jinbe agrees and hurries on ahead with a few of the prisoners. Mr. 3 of course wants nothing to do with fighting Magellan explaining he can only defend, though the prisoners that stayed are giving him encouragement. Mr. 3 then fits Luffy hands and feet with wax boxing gloves and shoes (similar to his ), much to Luffy's amazement and gratitude though Mr. 3 shouts at him to focus on Magellan. The Chief Warden comes at them with another , forcing Mr. 3 to create another . Luffy jumps out and hits Magellan with a . The attack knocks Magellan back with no effect on Luffy, effectively allowing the Straw Hat to fight toe to toe without getting poisoned. The other prisoners manage to find cannons which they stick through the candle wall and fire upon Magellan, hitting him further.

Meanwhile at the main entrance of Impel Down, the others have reached topside and have taken out the guards. Bon thinks it is clear sailing from there, but Mr. 1 tells him otherwise mentioning the battleships that await the group when they get outside. The other prisoners, however, are more than pumped for a fight and prepare for the worst as they open the gate. Much to their surprise, they find no guards waiting for them and there are no ships as well, Crocodile realizing that Magellan sent the Marine ships away to prevent the prisoners' escape. Just as the group begins to despair, Jinbe mentions that the order wasn't too long ago, so the ships have not gotten very far. He points out a ship just barely on the horizon. When asked how they'll reach it, Jinbe takes out one of the entrance doors, gives one of the prisoners a Den Den Mushi then jumps into the water.

Buggy, Mr. 1 and Crocodile jump onto the door before Jinbe carries it from under the water toward the ships. The prisoners over more than over-enthusiastic at the sight of seeing two Warlords of the Sea on their side in action, as well as their savior Buggy along with them, though Buggy just jumped on to get away from the prison so as not to face Magellan. Just as the four near the Marine ships, the Marines spot them and open fire. Jinbe dodges them and states that he is going to launch them onto the ship before going underwater. Buggy begins to freak out as their speed drops and the makeshift raft is on the verge of hitting the ships. Jinbe, meanwhile, gathers as much power as he can before sending it out into a strong ocean current that rockets Buggy, Crocodile and Mr. 1 onto the deck of one of the ships. The Marines quickly point their guns at the bunch but before they can, Jinbe hits the ship with a  much to Crocodile's annoyance. Jinbe apologizes mentioning he got careless with the ship they were supposed to use.

Back on Level 1, Magellan suddenly shifts to a new type of poison called  which he explains can destroy Impel Down itself. Luffy tries to hit him with his , but the poison quickly spreads to the wax armor. Mr. 3, seeing this, cancels the wax armor before it infects Luffy. Magellan unleashes the ultimate power of his devil fruit, , forming his poison globs into a giant skull-faced being. One of the escapees unfortunately gets hit by this and begs another to take him along. The poison on the man spreading to the one he grabbed and poisoning him too. Mr. 3 tells Luffy the poison now acts like an infection and that wax, or stone is now useless on it thus the group is forced to run away. Topside, the inmates, along with Bon Kurei, continue to wait at the entrance for Jinbe and the others noticing they hear cannon fire. Bon, however, worries that even if they grabbed a ship, the distance back would be too great, and Magellan could catch up to them by then. On the ship, the Marines attack Crocodile and Mr. 1 full force but are easily decimated within seconds. One of the neighboring ships opt to sink the ship they are on, but Jinbe attacks them with more water currents, soaking the gunpowder.

Back at the entrance, Luffy's group have finally made it topside with Magellan on their tail, and with nowhere left to run and a ship not yet procured the group are trapped. Suddenly, Iva comes crashing through the floor in his big head mode (having used his  to propel himself up) much to the surprise of everyone, though he hit his head coming up and knocked himself out. He is also carrying Inazuma who's still reeling from the poison effects. The Den Den Mushi that was given to the inmates rings revealing Jinbe on the other end, informing the group they've managed to procure a ship. However, the distance is still a problem especially with Magellan closing in fast. Jinbe informs the group to jump into the ocean and to leave the rest to him. The others argue on that since they are in the Calm Belt (which has Sea Kings swimming underwater) but Luffy decides to trust Jinbe since he a friend of Ace. Magellan closes in ready to finish them with his , but Luffy goes  while Mr. 3 sets up another . Luffy kicks into it with his  pushing it into  and knocking Magellan back. As the wall starts to crumble, Luffy quickly wakes up Iva and asks him to do his  then tells everyone to grab onto Iva's face. Just as Magellan is about to attack again, the wink propels everyone out into the sea.

As they are about to land in the water, something catches them which the group finds, much to their amazement, is a school of whale sharks. Having been called into the Calm Belt by Jinbe, he has them brought towards the captured Marine ship. Luffy and the rest cheer that they successfully made it onto the battleship, but Jinbe tells them it's too early to celebrate while manning the wheel. After everyone thanks the departing whale sharks, Iva orders one of the candies to find all the medicine onboard and start treating Inazuma immediately. Meanwhile, Magellan orders one of the other ships to return and pick him up so he could deal with Luffy and them himself, as they have not fully escaped yet. A  Rear Admiral orders all cannons to fire after his subordinate tells him that the cannons damaged by Jinbe were repaired. All the battleships fire upon the escapees' ship while pursuing them, knowing the Gates of Justice would not open for the escapees. Jinbe calmly states that they'll just charge on through while Luffy orders the ship to go on the defensive. Crocodile rebukes him and says to fire their cannons instead, which Buggy repeats to the crew but makes it sound like it's his idea. During the chase, the Gates of Justice suddenly open to the shock of the Marines and to the joyful surprise of Luffy and the others. Magellan, too, is stunned as the Gates could only be opened by Impel Down.

Inside Impel Down, one of the jailers asks "Magellan" if it's okay to allow the stolen ship to pass through the Gates of Justice. "Magellan" asks in return when his orders have even been mistaken and adds to make sure the Gates close after the ship has passed through. On one of the Marine ships, the commander orders the continued chase, wondering why Magellan ordered the gates to be opened. A subordinate states that he saw Magellan still on the docks of Impel Down so he could not have given such an order. Back inside Impel Down, Magellan rushes into the gate Monitor Room to find someone impersonating himself. On their ship, Luffy asks Jinbe about Bon Kurei and learns that the latter had stayed behind to open the Gates for them. The Magellan that made the order was really Bon Kurei using his Devil Fruit ability. Luffy wants to go back, but Jinbe asks how many allies they lost during their escape. If they went back, there would be more casualties and they'd lose more time. Jinbe recalls Bon telling him his idea and asked to not tell Luffy about it until after they lost communications with Impel Down. Jinbe hands Luffy the Baby Den Den Mushi but tells him to hurry as once they passed through the Gates, they'd be out of range.

Back inside Impel Down, Bentham reveals himself to everyone's shock and said that he copied Magellan while disguised as Hannyabal. Suddenly, Luffy's voice speaks over the Baby Den Den, to Bon's dismay, as he had hoped Jinbe would wait until later to tell Luffy. Luffy asks Bon why he stayed behind and adds that they were to escape together this time. Everyone else on the ship, even Buggy, Mr. 3, and Iva, call out to Bon while their ship presses on through the Gates. Knowing this, Luffy thanks Bon Kurei for his help. A teary-eyed Bon speaks into the Baby Den Den Mushi, telling Luffy to save Ace as he knows Luffy can do it. The Gates close after the ship makes it through, cutting off their pursuers. Luffy, Iva, and everyone else (excluding Crocodile, Mr. 1, Inazuma, and Jinbe) wails Bon's name while crying. Back at Impel Down, Bon prepares to fight Magellan, with the warden angrily asking if he had any last words, with Bon answering that he had no regrets. He thinks about Luffy and hopes for them to meet again on the field of Okama.

A text box states that "On that day Impel Down suffered its greatest defeat and disgrace in its history, Luffy and 241 total prisoners escaped." However, it is said that the incident did not end there. Meanwhile, only four hours remain until Ace's execution.

Back in Impel Down, the Blackbeard Pirates are seen alive and well again, making their way through Level 4, having been saved by Shiryu, whoÂ comments on their fight with Magellan. The BlackbeardÂ Pirates, however, praise theirÂ luckÂ for getting the antidote to cure themselves from the poison and managing to survive another day. Blackbeard thanks Shiryu for saving them and invites the formerÂ Head Jailer of Impel Down to join them, which he accepts knowing what will happen if he stays in the prison. He also comments that he was waiting for a man like Blackbeard.

Meanwhile on sea on the  Tarai Current (which is the government's private route), Iva looks in on Inazuma, who is recovering from Magellan's poison. Surprisingly, Iva withheld using his  technique on him as does not wish to cut Inazuma's lifespan, claiming him too important to the revolutionaries to use such a dangerous technique. Meanwhile, most of the others are still weeping over Bon's sacrifice, Buggy tries to cheer them up by throwing a party/funeral in his honor, but Luffy punches him in the face, claiming Bon might still be alive. This prompts a fight between the two while Crocodile and Jinbe talk about Jinbe's ability to talk to fish and one of the reasons why Fish-Man are so secluded. Luffy joins Jinbe who thanks him for letting him join in the rescue attempt. He then formally introduces himself and reveals his Warlord of the Sea status in the process much to Luffy's shock since he did not know about this.

Buggy, however, is more worried about heading to Marineford even saying he wants to go back to prison, to which Crocodile reveals that it isÂ unavoidable since they are using the Marines private route which circles the Marine gates (from Impel Down to the now defunct Enies Lobby and finally Marineford) not to mention the upcoming war of Whitebeard and the Marines. This news shocks most of the inmates since they did not know that was the whole goal of the breakout and many begin to panic. Before this can go on further, the Den Den Mushi on the ship rings and Luffy picks it up to reveal Marine Officer on the other end bringing a report on the breakout before communication at Impel Down stopped.

Luffy and, oddly, Buggy are labeled as the masterminds behind the breakout. The Marine Officer goes on further, even revealing Buggy's "brotherly" relationship with Red-Haired ShanksÂ and his past apprenticeshipÂ on  Gol D. Roger's  crew, much to the shock of the inmates on board, although they found no connection between him and Ace, they still conclude that he is helping Luffy save him (although this was not the case). The Marine Officer lastly mentions they will not open the gate for them and that they will not be able to survive since they are on the marine current. However, Luffy responds back that he will rescue his brother no matter what before hanging up.

The prisoners begin to cheer on Buggy saying that he is truly a pirate hero whileÂ the stronger escapeesÂ on board talk about Buggy's past, each with their own opinionÂ on how a person with such a history can be so weak. Buggy though is reluctant since he knows the Marines will watch his every move from now on. Luffy mentions  Rayleigh to him, causing Buggy to ask how he's doing and causing his followers to marvel at him even further.

As they begin to cheer, Buggy becomes more nervous but realizes he could take advantage of the situation. The escapees suddenly start suggesting of a mutiny and take over the ship, but Buggy calms them down and proclaims that the coming war is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take down Whitebeard. Buggy's words move his followers, and they swear their loyalty to him, averting the mutiny. With that the ship sails on for Marineford.

Meanwhile at Marine Headquarters, noon has arrived, and three hours remain until Ace's execution. Ace is ordered to climb a set of stairs toward the gallows. As he does so, he remembers a promise he made to Luffy to live a life without regret and to one day go out at sea to live a life with more freedom than anyone. Ace reaches a gate at the top of the stairs and head through further toward his execution.

### __Marineford Arc__

#### Calm Before the Storm: Ace's SecretÂ Revealed[]

All around the world, people voice their opinions on the execution and if  Whitebeard will really show up. A few doubt his strength due to his old age and the number of the  Marine forces. Others, who personally met Whitebeard and even retired from piracy just by being around him, think otherwise. Even children know of Whitebeard's raw strength and sing a playground song about him. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of  Marineford, a city where the families of Marines reside, have been evacuated due to the coming war. On the  Sabaody Archipelago, monitors have been set up to broadcast the execution to its inhabitants as  Ace arrives at the execution stand. The patrol ships sent to deal with Whitebeard's forces are sunk and never heard from again. Thus, Marineford is understandably on edge as the three hours until the execution countdown.

John Giant rallies his forces as a staggering one hundred thousand elite troops prepare for battle. Fifty Marine ships are stationed around the island, with cannons lining the coastline. The remaining  Warlords of the Sea ( Kuma,  Moria,  Doflamingo,  Mihawk and  Boa Hancock) are at the forefront of it all. Ace is located atop the execution stand at the rear of the island. Watching over him are the three Marine  Admirals:  Kizaru,  Akainu, and  Aokiji. With this, nearly every justice force imaginable is gathered, waiting for Whitebeard to make his move. On the  Tarai Current,  Luffy and the  Impel Down escapees have finally reached the  gate to Marineford.  Jinbe tries to think of a way to penetrate it while  Buggy rallies his followers.

Back at the execution stand,  Sengoku tells  Garp that he is going to tell the audience "everything", to which Garp replies that he can do as he wishes. Sengoku then takes the stage and orders the executioners to step back a moment before addressing the audience through a  Den Den Mushi. He begins by stating there was something critical he needed to share about Ace before asking the Second  Division Commander who his father was. Ace replies that Whitebeard is his father, but Sengoku claims he is not. Sengoku then goes on to say that the Marines searched an island for the possibility that a certain man had born a child. Newborns, children yet to be born, and even the mothers, but they did not find anything. However, there was a reason for it, and that was Ace's mother.

Portgas D. Rouge, the mother of Ace, who was from the  South Blue on an isle known as  Baterilla, performed a feat that even the Marines did not think was possible. She had kept Ace in her womb for twenty full months, far past the point of Ace's natural childbirth. When Ace was eventually born, Rouge died, having used up all her strength. This took place exactly one year and three months after the death of Ace's true father. Sengoku then announces to the Marines and the world that Ace's father is none other than  Gol D. Roger himself. As the Marines react in shock to this, Garp recalls to himself when Roger asked him to take care of Ace, citing that his unborn child bears no sin just for being born.

#### Ace's Past: The Emperor Whitebeard[]

Around the world, the audience is shocked to learn that Roger had a son and that his bloodline lives on to this day. Those on Marineford are rendered speechless, though those that know Luffy personally (Hancock,  Koby, and  Helmeppo) are surprised to find out that Luffy and Ace are not actually related. Garp, meanwhile, continues to think of the past, when he met with Roger in his cell before his execution. Roger explained that he was going to have a son but would not live long enough to see him and personally requested Garp to take care of him, knowing what would happen if either Rouge or Ace were found by the  World Government. Garp seemed hesitant at first, but Roger was confident that Garp would honor his final request.

Shortly after Roger died, the Marines arrived on Baterilla, going off reports that Roger had acted unlike himself on the island. They begin to investigate all newborns, mothers, and pregnant women, even giving orders to kill any mother who may seem suspicious to them. Through it all, however, Rouge managed to keep Ace in her womb and avoid their notice. Eventually, the Marines left the island, and Rouge, under the care of Garp, was able to bear Ace safely. However, she only had a moment to hold her son before she died from exhaustion. A few years afterward, Garp left Ace under the care of  Curly Dadan, a friend of his and a caretaker of Luffy, which is how the two first met. Garp then goes back to his last meeting with Ace, who mentioned that both Luffy and he had the blood of world-class criminals in their veins, which he meant Luffy having the  Revolutionary leader,  Dragon's blood, and Ace the Pirate King's. He also took Portgas as his surname out of love for his mother, who saved his life.

In the present, Sengoku continues by mentioning that two years ago, Ace took to the sea as the captain of the  Spade Pirates. His strength and speed caused the World Government to realize that Roger's bloodline had not ended. However, Whitebeard had noticed it too, and he recruited Ace before the World Government could reach him. Sengoku, however, notes that Whitebeard did so to make Ace into the next Pirate King. Ace heavily denies it, but Sengoku rebuffs him, ending his speech by saying that if they left Ace that way, he would have surely stood above all other pirates, which is why this execution is so important, even if it meant going to war with Whitebeard.

One of the Marines suddenly reports that the Gates of Justice to Marineford have suddenly opened on their own and that they cannot contact the power room. On the other side of the gate, the escapees are bewildered that the gate is opening for them despite the Marines' claiming they would not open it. Buggy's followers think he was the one who did it, as he stands at the front of the ship with his arms outstretched, although he is just as confused as everyone else.

Back in Marineford, the order is given to prepare for battle as Sengoku looks on in surprise at the fleet of pirate ships approaching the base, all being led by pirate captains that have achieved infamy in the  New World and have come to support Ace, much to his surprise. The Marines, however, withheld firing on them, trying to locate Whitebeard himself. He arrives, but not from the front, rather from underwater having coated his ship to appear smack in the center of the bay of the island. The  Moby Dick, as well as three other ships with 14 commanders on board, arrive from underwater, much to the Marines' surprise. Whitebeard climbs to the front of his ship as he greets Sengoku, no longer hooked up to his medical equipment and ready for battle. He tells Ace to bear with it a little while Ace calls out to his "father."

With the gate unlocked, Luffy's group sails into Marineford.  Ivankov wonders if Dragon will come to help or not. Upon hearing this, Luffy reveals he and Ace are not related and reveals Ace is Gol D. Roger's son, much to the shock of everyone on board. Back at Marineford, the Marines wait in anticipation for Whitebeard to make the first move. Suddenly, he hits the air, cracking it like a mirror before it causes explosions, shocking the Marines. Luffy's ship draws closer, though he cannot see anything through the fog, while Ace begins to think back to his early days of piracy. Back then, he was a teenager and set off three years before Luffy, with both promising to meet each other again. Ace formed the Spade Pirates, and his actions soon gained the attention of the Marines (much to Garp's anger) as well as Whitebeard himself.

Not long after, Ace met with  Shanks personally, thanking him for saving Luffy's life, which the red-haired pirate used as a cause for celebration. Ace then met with Jinbe, seeking to gain an audience with Whitebeard. However, the fish-man refused, causing a fight between the two that lasted for five days, which ended in a stalemate as neither could overcome the other. Whitebeard soon located the group, which the Spade Pirates were no match for. Ace ordered his crew to run while he stayed behind and tried to hold Whitebeard off.

Whitebeard, impressed with his spirit and strength, offered Ace the choice to join his crew, which Ace refused at first. He was suddenly knocked out, and he gained consciousness on Moby Dick, where he was greeted by  Thatch, the Fourth Division Commander. Thatch explained that Ace's crew tried to get him back but were once more defeated and brought on board Whitebeard's ship. Despite this, Ace was not treated as a prisoner, and yet he still stubbornly refused to be part of the crew. Instead, he tried to assassinate Whitebeard numerous times (a total of 100 times, according to the crew) all of which ended in failure. Eventually, Ace gave up and officially joined after  Marco revealed that all the men aboard Whitebeard's ship, who are hated around the world, see him as a father, and likewise in kind he calls them his "sons."

After some time, Ace was nominated as the Second Division Commander; during this time, he met  Blackbeard, who suggested he take the job. Before he accepted, Ace revealed his past to Whitebeard, who laughed it off despite his rivalry with Gol D. Roger, claiming everyone was a child of the sea. Then the incident with Blackbeard killing Thatch happened, and Ace, in anger, swore to go after him.

Whitebeard and the others tried to talk him out of it, with the former getting an uneasy feeling about everything. However, Ace persisted, as Blackbeard was from his division and Thatch was his friend. He also wanted to take responsibility for Blackbeard's disgraceful actions. Back in the present, Ace pleads with the others to simply leave him behind, claiming his own cockiness was the cause of his own capture.

Whitebeard, however, claims that he was the one who let him go hunt down Blackbeard. When Ace calls him a liar, the other  Whitebeard Pirates all agree with their captain and vow to save Ace no matter what. Suddenly, a shaking is felt throughout the island, which Garp explains is caused by Whitebeard's seaquakes which produced tsunamis that are headed right back at Marineford. This is due to Whitebeard's  Devil Fruit, the  Gura Gura no Mi, which allows him to make earthquakes. Sengoku warns the Marines that military force alone will not be enough to stop Whitebeard, as he has the power to destroy the world itself. As the tidal wave closes in on the base and the world watches on, it is revealed that forty-seven pirate ships led by Whitebeard face off against the  Marine Headquarters and the Warlords of the Sea. Regardless of who wins, the current era of piracy is coming to an end.

#### WAR! Whitebeard Pirates vs. Marine Headquarters[]

The tsunamis are right above the heads of the Marines as they begin to panic (though Doflamingo is more excited than scared). Aokiji suddenly vanishes from his seat and uses  to freeze the waves before they crash down on the base. He then goes to attack Whitebeard, but the pirate captain easily stops the attack with an airquake, hitting the Admiral in the process and shattering him. Aokiji re-forms himself at the edge of the bay and uses his powers to freeze it as well. With the bay now frozen, Whitebeard's ships are unable to move, and the Marines begin to bombard them with cannon fire. The pirate captains respond in kind by charging out onto the now-frozen bay to do battle. The  Vice Admirals quickly meet them, and the fighting quickly reaches chaotic levels.

Mihawk, meanwhile, makes the first move out of the Warlords of the Sea, claiming he wants to see the difference in strength between himself and Whitebeard. He unsheathes his sword and lets out a tremendous slash that heads straight for the Moby Dick. However, before it can be hit,  Jozu, the Third Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, who lives up to his title by covering himself in  diamond, intercepts it. Kizaru suddenly make his move, appearing in the air and firing down an array of  light beams at Whitebeard. But this was also intercepted, this time by First Division Commander Marco, who is covered in blue flames after the attack. Marco states that Whitebeard cannot be taken on the first turn, prompting Kizaru to remark on how scary the Whitebeard Pirates are.

It turns out that Marco has eaten a rare,  mythical, Zoan Devil Fruit which grants him the  ability to turn into a phoenix. He and Kizaru wage a short battle in the skies, and Kizaru is knocked to the ground but immediately recovers. Kizaru then orders the  Giant Squad (a squad of  giant Marines) to be careful in their attack. However, Jozu counteracts this by hurling a huge iceberg at the Marines. As the Marines start to panic, the last Admiral, Akainu, calmly states that nobody will be able to protect Marineford if everyone is out to fight. Akainu produces a colossal  magma fist that obliterates the iceberg while also creating volcanic projectiles that destroy one of Whitebeard's ships in the process. Whitebeard patronizes him, saying: "Go and light the candles on a birthday cake instead, you magma brat!" Akainu replies that he was just lighting up Whitebeard's funeral. The pirates continue their assault on the Marines. Meanwhile,  Little Oars Jr., the descendant of "The Land-Pulling  Oars", charges in. The Marines start to panic, on account of Little Oars Jr.'s enormous size. Moria becomes excited at the thought of claiming Little Oars Jr.'s corpse, while Doflamingo comments on how the battle was getting interesting.

Little Oars Jr. quickly begins to fight his way to the plaza where Ace is being held. He destroys one of the Marine battleships in the process, giving a path to his fellow pirates. The Marines are forced to fall back to strengthen their defenses. Whitebeard, however, disapproves of Little Oars Jr. recklessly charging in, but Little Oars Jr. begs him to let him do as he pleases to save Ace. Whitebeard relents and orders his men to back him up as Little Oars Jr. continues to get closer to the execution stand. Meanwhile, Hancock attacks a group of pirates with her  Mero Mero powers, managing to turn the body parts she hits to stone and breaking them off in the process with her amazing agility. However, she not only attacks pirates but Marines as well. When asked by a bewildered Marine, Hancock states that while she agreed to join the battle, she never allied herself with the Marines. To her, all men are alike, except for Luffy. She then tells the Marines that they must consider her promise to the Marines fulfilled by virtue of her beauty.

Suddenly, Kuma lets loose an  from his  Nikyu Nikyu powers, creating a tremendous explosion that wounds Little Oars Jr. greatly. Ace looks on in horror, begging him to stop knowing that Little Oars Jr.'s size makes him an easy target and that he would never make it. As Little Oars Jr. reels from the damage, he remembers when Ace made him a conical straw hat to help keep his head shaded in the sun and his head dry during rainy and snowy weather. Oars Jr. is more than grateful for the gift, which is why he is determined to save Ace.

Unfortunately, he gets hit hard by cannon fire and begins to double over. As he does, Little Oars Jr. notices Doflamingo and tries to take him out, slamming at him with his fist. Doflamingo manages to avoid the attack, flips over Oars, and uses his  ability to cut off his right leg in the process, laughing all the while. Despite this, Little Oars Jr. desperately continues to advance towards Ace. Just as he is within inches of grabbing Ace, Moria sends his  shadows at the giant, forming them into a spear and skewering him through the midsection. The Whitebeard Pirates look on in horror as Little Oars Jr. falls, while the Warlords of the Sea give off different reactions, with Moria happy with his victory.

Doflamingo continues to find the whole thing hilarious, which catches the attention of one of the Division Commanders. Whitebeard, meanwhile, looks on grimly at what just occurred, prompting one of the Giant Squad Vice Admirals,  Lonz, to take advantage of his distraction and attack him. Whitebeard, however, subdues him easily with one hand, using his earthquake power, much to the shock of the Marines who are stunned that not even a giant can best the  Emperor. Whitebeard then orders his troops to take advantage of the path Little Oars Jr. gave them and charge into the plaza, to which the pirates quickly comply.

Meanwhile, "Water Buffalo"  Atmos confronts Doflamingo, who quickly uses his power to take control of him and attack his own squad. As the sight of fallen Marines starts to get to him, Koby flees from the battle. Helmeppo manages to stop him just in time as they witness Akainu confronting another officer who was also fleeing the battle. Akainu attacks the Marine soldier as punishment for his cowardice. He then gets a report that the preparations are complete. Doflamingo still continues to cackle as he uses Atmos to attack his allies. He comments on their current state of affairs and how the winner of this battle will become the "justice" of the world.

The pirates continue to press on to the bay, trying to keep the path that Little Oars Jr. opened up from being closed. Suddenly,  Whitey Bay, the "Ice Witch" crashes an icebreaker ship into another part of. With the bay breached on both sides, the pirates rush forward. An officer reports this to Sengoku, who comments that it does not matter. He calls  Tsuru, who is literally hanging out several pirates to dry as if they were laundry.

He reports over the Den Den Mushi that they are putting the plan into motion. Other Marine officials get the order too, which Whitebeard notices, making him wonder what Sengoku is up to. Garp suddenly climbs up to the execution stand, which prompts Sengoku to ask if he has a problem with the plan. Garp says that he does not, claiming that Ace is a pirate and that he feels no pity for him. However, he then states that Ace is also family, which puts Garp in conflict with what he is supposed to do. He scolds Ace, asking him why he did not just live as he had told him to. Sengoku warns Garp that if he tries anything, he will not hold back, but Garp just brushes him off, saying that if he could've done anything, he would've already done it.

Meanwhile, Luffy and the Impel Down escapees are trapped atop one of the frozen tsunami waves created by Whitebeard and Aokiji's powers. Luffy tries to talk the others into pushing the boat so that it will slide down the back of the wave. Before they do, though, the Den Den Mushi on board intercepts the order, which is to just ignore the schedule and execute Ace then and there. Panicking, Luffy tells the others that they need to hurry. Ivankov performs his  in hopes of shoving the battleship off of the wave. However, instead of sliding down, it is knocked forward, flipping upside-down and sending all of the inmates plummeting towards the sea.

Having also received the order, Koby and Helmeppo start to panic, but before they can react, the two notice something falling from the sky. Ace and the Marines see it too. As the object plummets closer to the ground, it is revealed that it's none other than Luffy and the escapees descending from above. As they plummet down, Luffy exclaims that he is not worried since he is made of rubber, but the others are distressed, yelling at him to do something before they make impact with the ice beneath them.

#### The Bet on the New Age: Luffy and Whitebeard![]

By sheer luck, the battleship lands in one of the few spots of ocean that remain unfrozen. Although the impact splits the boat in two, those on board fall into the ocean unharmed. Jinbe dives underwater to rescue the Devil Fruit users, as the others make their way up onto the wreckage.

As Luffy climbs higher on top of the wrecked battleship, he and Ace spot each other. Ace calls out to Luffy, who happily responds that he is happy to see him again. Onlookers are shocked that  Crocodile, as well as the other prisoners, have arrived in the middle of the war. Sengoku becomes even more infuriated at Garp and his accursed family, while Garp remains in shock that Luffy has made his way to Marineford.

The Warlords of the Sea, Admirals, and others all look on at the odd group and comment; Mihawk shows subtle surprise while Moria shows frothing rage.  Fullbody and  Jango comment on how Luffy's normal crew is not with him. Boa Hancock blushes in relief, seeing that Luffy is all right. Koby and Helmeppo are amazed at the fact that Luffy has broken out of Impel Down and arrived in Marineford. Aokiji states that Luffy has brought along tough allies, while Kuma remains silent. Kizaru remarks how he did not think that they would meet again so soon. Marco recalls that he is the one that Ace always talked about. Doflamingo remarks that all of the Warlords, old and new, are together again, and he shows interest in Luffy as a "famous troublemaker."  Smoker and  Tashigi wonder why Luffy and Crocodile are working together, and Akainu declares that Luffy must be disposed of (notably stating to himself that he is Dragon's son).

Jinbe announces to Sengoku that he has resigned his position as Warlord of the Sea. As Ivankov looks around, he notices that Crocodile has vanished; having made the first move, Crocodile appears behind Whitebeard, ready to impale him with his golden hook. Before he can, however, Luffy activates  and intercepts the blow. Crocodile reminds Luffy that they had a deal, to which Luffy responds that because Whitebeard is important to Ace, he would not let Crocodile touch him. Marco remarks to himself that Ace's brother is not half bad.

As Whitebeard observes Luffy, he recognizes the  straw hat as the one that Shanks used to wear. When he tells Luffy that he had seen the hat with "Red Hair," Luffy says that Shanks had let him borrow it. Whitebeard remembers the story that Shanks had told him about why his arm had gone missing: that he had placed it on "a bet on the  New Age." When asked if Luffy would still rescue his brother, even knowing the odds against him, Luffy not only emphatically responds that he will, but also that he, not Whitebeard, would be the Pirate King. This shocks all of the pirates and many Marines. Admiring Luffy's tenacity, Whitebeard merely tells Luffy to stay out of his way; Luffy states that he is going to rescue Ace on his own. Kizaru asks Sengoku if he can kill the intruders, which Sengoku allows.

Before charging into the battle, Luffy informs Whitebeard that he heard the Marines' plan to execute Ace ahead of schedule. Whitebeard realizes that while the information is important, Sengoku purposely leaked it so that the pirates panic and fall into his trap. As Marco joins Whitebeard's side, Luffy bolts towards Ace. Kizaru attempts to stop him by launching a kick of light at him. The attack is stopped, however, by Ivankov's , causing the two forces to collide in a massive explosion. When Luffy thanks him, Ivankov states that it is his duty to make sure Luffy does not go and kill himself. Buggy and the inmates, meanwhile, watch on in horror, unwilling to join such a terrifying battle yet acting as if Buggy is rallying them on.

Kuma fires one of his beams from his mouth, hoping to incinerate Luffy and Ivankov; the two dodge the blow as Ivankov grabs onto Luffy and rolls out of the way. Ivankov is shocked that Kuma would attack him, remembering that the two used to be friends. As Luffy continues his assault,  Hina reappears to capture Luffy, transforming her arms into long iron fences. Luffy manages to jump out of the ring using  as it ensnares Hina's Marine allies. Watching on with glee, Moria somehow manages to bring previously unseen zombies out of the earth to battle Luffy.

Ace suddenly cries out to Luffy to stay away, berating his brother for getting involved in his own affairs. He states that he would be too humiliated if a weakling like Luffy were to rescue him. However, his true reason for wanting to keep Luffy at bay was so that he would not drag his brother down with him. Luffy answers by shouting out that they are brothers and that he does not care about any rules about pirates. As Moria sends his zombies after Luffy, they are drowned and purified in a burst of seawater fired by Jinbe.

Much to the shock of the Marines, as well as Luffy's and Whitebeard's  subordinate crews, Sengoku reveals that Luffy's father is none other than the Revolutionary, Dragon. While Moria, Buggy, andÂ  Galdino seem shocked at the news, Mihawk says that at that point, that fact was hardly surprising. Hancock feels that she loves him even if his father was the devil. Kuma continues to remain expressionless, while Jinbe and Doflamingo realize that Luffy's actions finally make sense. Smoker is now able to understand why the revolutionary saved Luffy in  Loguetown.

Luffy remains unfazed by the fact that his lineage was revealed to everyone at Marineford, as well as the whole world, due to the reporters watching on. He smashes his way through more of the Marines with , claiming that he does not care if Ace objects, and that he would rescue Ace even if it killed him. Whitebeard, in even more awe than before, tells Marco that he will not forgive him if he lets Luffy die.

Having seen the determination shown by both Whitebeard, his subordinate crews, and Luffy, Ace finally states that he cares not what fate has in store for him, whether he is to be saved or killed. As Luffy, Ivankov, and Jinbe break through the Marine forces, Whitebeard recognizes Buggy and asks if he wants to take his head. Whitebeard proposes that the two instead team up temporarily to fight the Marines before Buggy takes his head, which Buggy agrees to. When Marco asks why Whitebeard would deal with someone as insignificant as Buggy, Whitebeard explains that it would be troublesome if they had to fight the inmates alongside the Marines.

Whitebeard then attempts to contact  Squard, but he is nowhere to be found, having been seen only minutes ago. Brushing this off, Whitebeard instead cuts through to the  Decalvan Brothers, whom he commands to take command of all the pirates. All of Whitebeard's subordinate crews then begin to split up, attacking Marineford from the left and right sides. Seeing the battleships being attacked, Garp and Sengoku realize that Whitebeard saw through their plan.

Meanwhile, Moria, unable to form zombies in the presence of Jinbe, steals the shadows of Marine soldiers and inserts them into his body, increasing his size and strength. He then lunges towards Jinbe, hoping to steal his shadow, but the fish-man retaliates with , slamming his fist into Moria and critically wounding him.

As Luffy continues to battle Marine soldiers, Smoker bursts towards him, intent on settling the score. Smoker manages to strike Luffy with his  Seastone  jitte, dealing more damage than Luffy would usually take. Luffy strikes back with , but the attacks slip right through Smoker's smoke. As Smoker and Luffy comment on how the other has grown stronger, the former pins the latter to the ground with his jitte.

Smoker muses on how he finally understands why Dragon saved Luffy back at Loguetown, while Luffy struggles to free himself from Smoker's restraint. Hancock suddenly kicks Smoker away, her  Haki allowing her to make contact with Smoker. When Smoker asks why Hancock is not fulfilling her duty as a Warlord, Hancock ignores the question. She states that she has never felt as angry as she has in her life and that she would not let anyone harm her beloved Luffy. Luffy shows gratitude for Hancock's assistance.

Across the battlefield, Kuma continues to attack Ivankov. Ivankov exclaims that if Kuma continues to attack him, then he will have no choice but to retaliate. Doflamingo butts in, stating that although he does not know what history the two have together, talking is useless, as "Tyrant Kuma" is already dead.

Hancock tells Luffy that she knew he would survive and make it to Marineford and gives him the key to Ace's handcuffs, which she gained through unknown means. Luffy suddenly hugs Hancock out of great gratitude, telling her that she is amazing and that he owes her. Blushing uncontrollably, Hancock tells Luffy that he should not mention it but that he has to go quickly. As Luffy runs off, Hancock falls to the ground in a swoon, wondering if Luffy's act of hugging her was marriage. Onlooking Marines confuse the interaction as Luffy knocking Hancock down. Smoker is still determined to take down Luffy and chases after him again. Hancock interferes once more, attacking with a  kick, causing Smoker's jitte to snap in two. Hancock then tells him that she will not let him pass. When Smoker asks if Hancock realizes the consequences of getting in the way of the Marines, she says that whatever she does, she will be forgiven. Luffy, thankful for how helpful Hancock is, makes his way to where Ivankov and Kuma are battling.

Meanwhile, Ivankov tells Doflamingo that Kuma is standing before him and cannot be dead. Luffy recognizes Kuma and asks Ivankov if he and Kuma know each other, which Ivankov confirms while stating that something is wrong with Kuma.

Doflamingo tells Ivankov that while the two seemed to know Kuma, the man standing before them was no longer Kuma, as  Vegapunk had finished his modifications on the former Bartholomew Kuma. Doflamingo then explains to Ivankov the process Kuma volunteered to undergo, as his body was converted into a " Pacifista", with bits and pieces of him being modified at a time. Ivankov says that Doflamingo is lying as Kuma hated the World Government and would never work with them. While Doflamingo admits that he does not know what kind of deal Kuma and the World Government made. He goes on to say that not only a few days ago Kuma was still himself, but now he is a walking corpse with no human memory, following the World Government's every command: PX-0.

Kuma fires a laser blast from his mouth, sending Luffy and Ivankov flying. Ivankov asks Kuma what happened to his body, while Luffy remembers that Kuma had stated before that they would "never meet again." Kuma suddenly appears in the middle of Ivankov's Newkama army and launches a pressure cannon through a line of  Okamas. Refusing to take any more of Kuma's actions, Ivankov spins his head around with  to make a mirage of dozens of faces and launches Death Wink from all of them with . Ivankov then kicks Kuma and sends him flying, shouting that he would not let Kuma get away with hurting his followers. He then states that as no one who ever saw his face could ever forget it, if Kuma somehow forgot his fear of Ivankov, then the Okama would just have to pound it back into his body. Preparing to fight Kuma, Ivankov sends his army to support Luffy as he heads for the gallows. At the same time, Buggy tells his army of escapees not to fall behind, while Mr. 3 asks Buggy if he is serious about his plan.

Meanwhile, Crocodile and  Mr. 1 have been carving through all that gets in their way as Crocodile proceeds towards Whitebeard. While many of Whitebeard's crew attempt to stop Crocodile from attacking the old man again, Crocodile brushes them aside with a sandstorm. Jozu then lunges at Crocodile, using Haki to strike Crocodile with his  attack. As Jozu attempts to attack Crocodile again, he is stopped by Doflamingo, who is riding on his back and controlling his movement. Although Crocodile seems antagonistic towards Doflamingo, Doflamingo asks if he and Crocodile can team up.

As Luffy continues to head towards the gallows, yet another enemy crosses his path. Mihawk apologizes to Shanks, as he will not hold himself back. Luffy recognizes Mihawk, who wonders if "The Next Generation's Golden Child" is finished or if he will escape Mihawk's  black blade.

Although Mihawk stands before him, Luffy knows he has no time to fight Mihawk, so he bursts past him with his superhuman speed. However, Hawk-Eyes, peering through the crowd, manages to find Luffy and swings his blade forward, slashing Luffy as well as all those between the two. After sending Luffy careening into a wall, Mihawk pursues him, attempting to impale him. However, two Newkama soldiers get in the way of Mihawk, who brushes them aside with little effort. Luffy attempts to attack Mihawk again, but realizing that the Warlord of the Sea would slice his arm off, he halts his attack at the last moment, instead choosing to run away. Mihawk comments that Luffy is unusually calm as he slices horizontally at the rubber man. Luffy dodges Mihawk's attack as it slices a frozen wave in to, with the upper half crashing down on Marineford,

Across the battlefield, Crocodile turns down Doflamingo's offer, saying that Doflamingo is not at his level and that instead Doflamingo could be his underling. Doflamingo laughs at how he thought Crocodile would be rational; the latter states that if he were, he would not have come to Marineford in the first place. He then performs , attempting to blow Doflamingo away. The attack is not confined to Doflamingo, though, as Buggy is accidentally sucked into the vortex as well.

As Luffy and Mihawk continue their battle, the latter notes how Luffy is moving away from the execution platform. In a move of desperation, Luffy grabs onto Buggy and uses him as a shield against Mihawk's attack. Buggy screams angrily at Luffy as the latter continues to use him as a shield. Getting fed up, Buggy launches a  at Mihawk, who casually deflects it with his blade, causing it to explode in Buggy's face. Luffy, having finally gotten a break, dashes back towards the platform.

Seeing that Mihawk was going to attack Luffy again, Marco calls over Whitebeard's Fifth Division Commander,  Vista, to interfere and hold Mihawk back. When Mihawk recognizes him, Vista is happy that Mihawk has heard of him. Mihawk replies by saying that only a fool would not have heard of him. As Luffy continues to make his way towards the platform, Mihawk comments on how he has the strange ability to make anyone around him an allyâan ability that is the most dangerous in the world.

The battle continues to rage on, while the onlookers at Sabaody Archipelago watch on in horror. As the civilians begin to realize that Ace is to be executed early, Sengoku demands that the feed be cut off, so that the civilians will not lose faith in the Marines, as such a tragedy would be too much for them to witness. Sengoku justifies his actions by saying that all they needed to say to the world after the battle was over would be one word: "Victory."

Suddenly, more battleships begin to appear from behind. The pirates note that the new arrivals are not allies, with Whitebeard, Luffy, and Ivankov recognizing those on board.  Sentomaru arrives at the battle, backed up by an army of at least twenty Pacifistas. The battle has gone on for an hour and a half, and it is about to enter its final phase.

#### Sengoku's Plan: The Battle's Final Phase[]

Both pirates and civilians look on in horror as the Pacifistas arrive, as the only knowledge the pirates had was rumors that Vegapunk had been using human corpses to develop a human weapon. However, they are mystified as to why they are all Kuma. Sentomaru tells Kizaru that things were not going according to plan, as the pirates were meant to be all driven into the bay instead of being scattered as they were. As the pirates listen on, they realize that Whitebeard knew that the Marines were going to pin them all into the bay and had saved their lives when he told his men to split up. Sengoku demands that they continue with the plan, attacking any stragglers that they can reach. Sentomaru asks Kizaru if it is okay if the Pacifistas destroy some of the Marines' battleships as well, to which Kizaru simply replies that they should not destroy too many.

As Sentomaru commands the Pacifistas to begin their attack, a pirate tries to smash one with an enormous club, which shatters on impact against the Pacifista. It retaliates by firing a laser beam from its mouth. The Pacifistas all join together in their assault, firing lasers from their mouths and hands. Whitebeard, disgusted at the Marines' willingness to sacrifice their own ships, commands his men to ignore the attacks from behind and continue onwards to the execution platform.

Sengoku, in return, tells the Marines to draw back from the ice and keep the pirates away from the platform. The onlookers at Sabaody are awestruck by how invincible the Pacifista are. Before they can see much more, all but one video feed is cut. Sengoku commands that as soon as Ace is executed, the pirates must be wiped out at once. Luffy, rushing to get to Ace before he is executed, is stopped by Kizaru, who sends him flying with a kick of light. Luffy is caught by Jinbe, who encourages Luffy by saying that they knew their enemies would be strong from the start. Giving Luffy a moment of reprieve, a group of Whitebeard's Division Commanders rushes forward to stop Kizaru, who calmly states that the situation is terrifying.

Moria, having apparently given up on his battle with Jinbe, confronts Tenth Division Commander  Curiel, saying that whether he fights Moria or continues into the bay, he will be destroyed. Moreover, he says that while he does not care who wins, it would be hilarious if Whitebeard died. Curiel responds by firing his guns at Moria, stating that he will not let Whitebeard or Ace die. Mihawk and Vista continue their clash. Mihawk says that their duel must come to an end, to which Vista replies that they each have a point in their favor. Tashigi and Smoker, apparently no longer fighting Hancock, move on, saying that they are done there. Hancock, meanwhile, hopes Luffy can reach his brother on time.

Sengoku asks if they have stopped broadcasting and finds out that one camera is still running from an unknown source. It is revealed that the camera was hijacked by the Impel Down prisoners, who are recording Buggy with it in an attempt to make him famous. Through many takes, Buggy attempts to make a good impression upon the baffled onlookers at Sabaody. The civilians, though, are unimpressed, wanting instead to see the battle taking place.

As Squard appears on the Moby Dick, Whitebeard asks if he is unharmed, as he has not been able to contact him. Squard apologizes, reporting that the pirates in the rear have been hit badly. Whitebeard states that they have the Marines where they want them and that he will fight alongside the others. Squard says that all of them owe him a great debt and that they'll give their lives for the Whitebeard crew. Marco, having just noticed that someone was on the ship with Whitebeard, casually turns to face him. Squard suddenly impales Whitebeard through the chest with his blade, horrifying Ace, Luffy, Jinbe, Ivankov, Buggy, all of the Division Commanders, and all the onlookers at the Sabaody Archipelago. While Mihawk, Sentomaru, and the Admirals remain unfazed, Doflamingo and Moria take great pleasure in witnessing the assault.

Enraged, Marco pins Squard down, asking how he could do such a thing. Squard knocks him aside, saying that it was their fault that it happened. As Whitebeard's other subordinate crews continue to take attacks from the Pacifistas, Squard claims that he knew about Whitebeard's "deal with the Marines." He also berates Whitebeard for not telling him that Ace was the son of Gol D. Roger, whom he deeply loathed for the massacre of his crew by Roger's hand. He also claims that Whitebeard sold out his subordinate crews, as his deal with Sengoku was that he, his crew, and Ace would be allowed to be set free as long as all of the other pirate captains died. He supports his claim by pointing out how the Pacifistas are only targeting the subordinate captains. He then states that although he was lucky to manage to get an attack in on Whitebeard, he was ready for his death as punishment.

Marco tells Squard that he was tricked and that he should've trusted Whitebeard. Whitebeard states that the Marines have manipulated Squard with his hatred for Roger and that they were one step ahead. Before any more could be broadcast to the public, Sengoku calls out to Aokiji, who proceeds to freeze Buggy and the other Impel Down escapees, cutting out the final video feed.

Crocodile, genuinely shocked that Whitebeard had been so easily overcome, cries out that the weak man before him could not have been the man who so easily defeated him before. Marco, wondering how Whitebeard could have been so easily caught off guard, realizes that it is due to his degrading health.

Whitebeard looks down on a terrified Squard, angrily asking how he could raise his sword against his father. However, instead of harming him, Whitebeard instead hugs his "son," saying that even if he is a fool, he still loves him. When Whitebeard asks who it was who convinced Squard to turn against him, Squard reveals that it was Akainu, who had stated that he was opposed to the operation and that they only intended to kill Whitebeard and spare the others. He further tells Squard that, if opportunity presents itself, he should kill Whitebeard so that his crew will be unharmed. Whitebeard states that he knew how much Squard hated Roger, but that it was foolish to hold children accountable for the sins of their fathers and that Squard and Ace, as his family, should be good to each other.

To dispel the doubt beginning to grow within the other captains, Whitebeard shatters the frozen waves with his Devil Fruit powers, giving his subordinate crews a route to escape if they so choose. Whitebeard claims that those who call themselves pirates should choose for themselves what to believe. Witnessing the act of selflessness, the other captains' faith in Whitebeard is instantly renewed. Whitebeard considers to himself that, although people may call him weak, a demon, or a monster, he is only one man with one heart, and as he cannot be the "strongest" forever, he should be allowed to raise one young life for the future.

He then shouts out that those who would follow him should be ready to lose their lives, as he lunges towards the execution platform and into the battlefield. Sengoku calls out for the Marines to be ready, as the "Strongest Man in the World" is about to attack. As Whitebeard charges into battle, all of his crew and subordinate crews follow behind and open a path for him.

One of the Decalvan Brothers comments on how hard it must be for Squard to have been tricked and to be responsible for stabbing Whitebeard, causing Whitebeard's subordinate crews to scream that they'll never forgive the Marines. As Squard wallows in the grief of his own sins, Marco asks him if just crying will help set things right.

Luffy, musing on how strong Whitebeard must be, continues to run head-long towards the execution platform. Ivankov notes that all of the Marines are retreating into the plaza. While Jinbe agrees that it is worrisome, he states that there is no time to think, as Whitebeard is on the move. John Giant then appears on the front line, ready to stop Whitebeard and his crew with his and Whitebeard's weapons.

Whitebeard then surprises the giant by causing an earthquake so massive that the entire island tilts to one side. As the Marines panic, Doflamingo laughs about how insane Whitebeard is, while Hancock continues to care only for Luffy's safety. Whitebeard then delivers a quake-imbued punch to John Giant's chest, defeating him.

As onlookers wonder why the quakes are not affecting the execution platform, they see that the three Admirals are somehow holding it together, as the three banter about how it is each other's fault that the wall is not up yet. The pirates finally make it towards the city when dozens of walls shoot up from the ground, blocking their path. As much as the pirates try to attack it, the wall will not budge. Cannons emerge from the walls, preparing to fire. However, one wall near the front remains open, with Oars Jr.'s body blocking the wall's path and his blood interfering with the system. Although the situation is not ideal, Sengoku commands Akainu to attack anyway. Akainu uses , causing a storm of flaming fists to rain down upon the pirates.

Back at the Sabaody Archipelago, reporters and bystanders are complaining about the video feed getting cut. They barrage the stationed Marines with questions, asking if Whitebeard and the Marines really made a bargain and if Whitebeard sold out his subordinate crews.  Eustass Kid and  his crew decide to leave since the show's over. The other  Supernovas, all alive and well on Sabaody, comment on the situation.

Meanwhile, Akainu's attack is wreaking havoc on the pirates, destroying all their footing. Moby Dick is struck down in the attack and is completely destroyed. As the seawater begins to turn to magma, the cannons from within the iron wall begin firing at the pirates, restraining them at the center of the enclosure. Whitebeard attempts to use his Gura Gura no Mi powers to smash through a section of the wall, but the blow only dents it.

Seeing as everything is going according to plan, Sengoku announces that it is time to execute Ace. The pirates decide that to reach Ace, they need to climb over Oars Jr. As Ivankov and Jinbe look for Luffy, they see that he is recklessly running through the path with the other pirates and is forced back by an explosion. Ivankov berates Luffy, stating that the one path through would be the most guarded. As Jinbe and Ivankov wonder how they'll manage to pass through, Luffy asks a favor of Jinbe.

Oars Jr. surprisingly rises, having been awakened by the blast. As the Marines all aim at him, preparing to finish him off, a pillar of water flies through the sky, soaring over the gap in the wall and landing right in front of the execution platform. From the water emerges Luffy, wielding a mast from one of the ships in his hands. Standing right before Luffy, the Admirals all comment on his boldness. Luffy tries to strike the Admirals with the mast, but Aokiji freezes it. He then uses , which shatters the frozen mast.

Whitebeard notes how Luffy's recklessness is just like Ace's. He orders Oars Jr. to stay where he is and commands Jozu to prepare their trump card.

#### An Ant in a Storm: Luffy Falters[]

As the Admirals dodge the projectiles formed from the frozen mast, Luffy activates , hoping to make a straight dash for Ace. However, Kizaru easily catches up to him and knocks him aside with a kick of light.

On the execution platform, the guards are about to execute Ace. However, they are blown back by an unknown force, which is revealed to be an attack by none other than Crocodile. While Sengoku wonders why Crocodile would aid his own enemy, the former Warlord notes that he only did it because he did not want to see the Marines satisfied. Suddenly, taking everyone by surprise, Crocodile's head comes flying off of his body. Doflamingo, standing behind Crocodile, says that he is jealous that he has decided to side with Whitebeard instead of him. Forming his head back onto his body, Crocodile responds that he is not teaming up with anyone and attacks Doflamingo.

Meanwhile, Luffy is knocked down after Aokiji stabs him with an ice saber. Hancock screams at Aokiji and prepares to interfere, but instead Marco knocks Aokiji away.

The pirates in the bay, attempting to make their way past the iron wall, all try to swim through the gateway made by Oars Jr. As the Marines prepare to fire upon the susceptible pirates, a coated ship suddenly emerges from beneath the sea, allowing most of those in the water to climb aboard. Whitebeard notes that he never said that all of his ships had surfaced. While the Marines are busy debating whether or not they should aim at Oars Jr. or the ship, Oars Jr. lifts the ship into the air and pulls it through the hole he created. As the pirates prepare to storm the stage, Oars takes cannon fire, causing him to collapse once more. Whitebeard then leaps into the plaza and, commanding his "children" to keep away, swings his  naginata in a circle, knocking away all of the Marines in his path.

With the only Marines still standing being the Admirals, a few of the Vice Admirals, and those upon the podium, the Whitebeard Pirates prepare to make their final charge to save Ace. Sengoku then tells Garp that the two of them will be required to join the war. Whitebeard orders his men to clear a path for him as he once again makes a swing with his naginata to create another earthquake. Knowing the coming threat, Aokiji tries to attack the Emperor only to have his  slice in two by Whitebeard's earthquakes. Whitebeard then impaled Aokiji with his naginata. However, the attack has no effect, as Aokiji made a hole in his chest so that the attack can pass through it. Just as Aokiji is about to try another attack, Jozu knocks him away and tells Whitebeard he will take care of him as Aokiji re-forms himself.

Meanwhile, Luffy once again tries to reach the execution platform but is stopped by  Momonga and is forced to engage in a fight against him as well as another Vice Admiral with a  Zoan Devil Fruit. Despite his best efforts, he is easily overwhelmed. He is then suddenly shot by a light beam by Kizaru. As Luffy lays defeated, the Admiral reminds him that he lacks the proper strength to save Ace and that guts alone will not get him through. He then kicks him back, right into Whitebeard, who catches him. Kizaru is insulted that the Emperor sent in Luffy first. Ivankov, using his , peers over the wall and sees the condition Luffy is in, scolding him for acting so recklessly. Whitebeard tosses Luffy to one of his men to tend to his wounds, but Luffy shouts that he is alright and must save Ace. However, his wounds get to him, and he collapses as Jinbe asks a nearby doctor to look him over.

Whitebeard mentions that Luffy has heart but agrees that he is too reckless, though he has a soft spot for people like him. Whitebeard once again attacks all the Marines in his way before being stopped by Akainu. He engages the Admiral in a battle of sheer power. Jinbe decides to join in as well, deciding that he will die in the battle. All around the plaza, pirates and Marines continue to battle, with neither side backing down. Marco attempts to reach Ace but is knocked back by Garp, who proclaims that if any of them want to get past him, it will have to be over his dead body.

Whitebeard tells his subordinate crews not to be intimidated by Garp, as he is just an old man. Akainu reminds Whitebeard that they are of the same generation before proceeding to fire a hound made of magma at Whitebeard. He deflects the attack and causes more damage to Marineford.

The pirates continue to cut a path through the Marines' forces, heavily damaging a Pacifista in the process. Ace suddenly begins to cry as he recollects on his childhood; everyone with whom he had spoken about Roger despised the man, causing Ace to retaliate by beating them half to death. Ace had once asked Garp if he really should've been born. Garp replied by saying that was something that could only be discovered by living.

As the war rages on, Ace begins to reflect on how everyone is giving their all to save him. He states that he is so happy that his allies care enough to spill blood for him that he cannot stop crying and that he suddenly has the desire to live.

Meanwhile, Buggy and the escapees from Impel Down remain on a block of ice outside of the encircling wall. One of the pirates tells Buggy that he was thawed by the sea of magma. Buggy says to himself that he plans to take out his vengeance on the Marines. Suddenly, Whitebeard collapses, succumbing to the effects of old age. Marco rushes to protect him, but in his frenzy, he is unable to foresee an attack by Kizaru, which pierces through him. Jozu, distracted by Kizaru's attack, has his arm frozen over by Aokiji. Akainu then deals a devastating magma-powered blow directly into Whitebeard's chest.

Ivankov admonishes the collapsed Luffy, who had asked for another dosage of . Ivankov states that Luffy had been through too much over the course of Impel Down to then, and that pushing himself any further would mean throwing his life away. Luffy states that he will do whatever he can, even if he dies, as being unable to fight and failing to save Ace would make him want to die anyway. Ivankov chides Luffy, stating that if Luffy dies, then he would be unable to face Dragon ever again. Despite this, Ivankov tells Luffy that he can have it "his own damned way," injecting him with another shot of . Empowered once more, Luffy stands up and lets out a scream of resolve.

Again, the Marine guards prepare to execute Ace. Luffy charges forward, followed by Ivankov, who remind Luffy that his  make his body believe he is healed while his wounds still need healing. As they fight their way forward, Luffy sees Koby ahead of him. Koby tells himself he has to fight Luffy or else he will never change. He charges at Luffy using Soru, but Luffy counters with a , knocking Koby out. Suddenly, however, he is attacked by more Pacifistas, who prepare to fire beams from their mouths. Hancock suddenly steps in, whom the Pacifistas recognize as an ally and stand down, allowing Luffy and Ivankov to pass. When the Pacifistas order Hancock to step aside, she attacks one, saying she does not want the likes of him to say her name.

Marco tries to face Kizaru, but  Onigumo appears from behind, clasping a Seastone handcuff on one of his wrists, negating his Phoenix powers. Using this opportunity, Kizaru fills more holes in him with his light spears. Jozu, meanwhile, is left entirely frozen by Aokiji, and his right arm is broken off. The pirates are shocked that the top two Whitebeard commanders were beaten.

Sengoku, telling the Marines not to lower their guard yet, orders them to take Whitebeard's head. As the Marines approach Whitebeard, the pirates try to reach him, but he orders them to stay back, saying he does not need their help just yet. He then defeats the oncoming Marines, shouting "I am Whitebeard," sending multiple Marines flying and causing others to call him a monster.

Whitebeard says he knows the significance of his death and the consequences that it will bring, but he will not die until he has secured the future of his "sons" with his own hands. Jinbe and the other pirates then stand behind Whitebeard, claiming to defend his honor, while he calls them foolish. Sengoku berates Whitebeard and tells him to watch the future of his children as the guards prepare their weapons to execute Ace. The pirates call out to Ace, and while Whitebeard says that it is useless to try, he suddenly collapses due to his illness as he watches the guards about to execute Ace.

Luffy shouts for the Marines to stop, unleashing a great burst of  Haoshoku Haki that takes out the executioners and most of the Marines and pirates alike, to the shock of Sengoku and Aokiji (who wonder if this is really happening), and the amazement of Ivankov and Whitebeard.

#### The Will of D.: Everyone's Faith is in Luffy![]

As everyone tries to recover from Luffy's massive burst of Haki, Whitebeard's subordinate crews and the Marines alike all stand in awe of his power. Vice Admiral  Doberman warns the Marines that Luffy has to be cut down or else he will become a fearsome force in the future. When Ivankov asks Luffy how he got that level of power of Haki, Luffy responds that he has no idea what Ivankov is talking about. Ivankov lets Luffy be, but realizes that even if Luffy does not realize it, he attracts people because of his will to fight the unknown, the same as Dragon. The Marines convene around Whitebeard once more, who again brushes them aside. He then commands all of his forces to back up Luffy. Whitebeard thinks to himself that he wants Luffy to show him just what will come at the end of the Great Age of Pirates.

As Luffy is about to be attacked, Whitebeard's subordinate crews jump in and protect him, telling him that he has to go on ahead while Whitebeard holds the Marines off. Ivankov tells Luffy that Whitebeard is putting all of his faith in him. Luffy responds that he does not care about Whitebeard and that he is only there to save Ace. Mihawk attempts to attack Luffy but is stopped by Mr. 1, who responds to Luffy's shock by saying that he is protecting him only on Crocodile's orders. After Mihawk strikes Mr. 1 down, Crocodile interferes and protects his right-hand man.

Sentomaru yells at Hancock for stopping a great number of Pacifistas, asking why she is doing it if she is on their side. She responds by shrieking that "love is always a hurricane," leaving him quite puzzled.

Ivankov asks someone unseen for help, and none other than  Inazuma, conscious once more, emerges. He leaps from Ivankov's hair and, cutting up the ground around him, makes a walkway that leads to the execution platform. Luffy thanks Inazuma and runs up towards Ace. Many of the Marines try to stop Luffy, but they are halted by Whitebeard and his forces. Whitebeard's subordinate crews, as well as Buggy and the prisoners, watch Luffy get closer and closer to Ace. However, Garp leaps down and lands between Luffy and Ace, cracking the ground with his impact. Luffy tells Garp to move aside, but Garp refuses, as he is a Marine Headquarters Vice Admiral.

Inazuma's bridge begins to collapse. Garp claims that he has been fighting pirates since before Luffy was born, and so Luffy will have to kill Garp if he wishes to reach Ace. Claiming that he considers Luffy an enemy, the two prepare to swap blows as Luffy enters . However, Garp falters at the last second, allowing Luffy to knock him aside and send him plummeting into the concrete. Sengoku scoffs at Garp's frailty as Luffy makes the final leap to the platform.

Kizaru strikes Whitebeard with a beam of light, stunning him long enough to make a move. Luffy pulls out the key Boa Hancock gave him and is about to unlock Ace's handcuffs. However, Sengoku reveals his  Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Daibutsu Devil Fruit ability, transforming into an enormous golden Buddha-like being. Just before Luffy can insert the key into Ace's cuffs, Kizaru fires a beam of light, breaking the key in two. One of the fallen guards beside Ace rises, revealing himself to be a disguised Mr. 3. Luffy asks Mr. 3 to protect Ace with his  wax as he holds Sengoku back with a  as Sengoku unleashes an enormous punch on Luffy. The blow causes the scaffold to collapse, with Ace, Luffy, and Mr. 3 falling with it.

Mr. 3 quickly forms a key out of wax in an attempt to free Ace. Thinking of  Bentham's sacrifice, Mr. 3 asks Luffy if he would laugh at him if he stated that he was there to avenge a fallen comrade. Luffy, of course, says that he would not. Just as Luffy receives the key, the Marines open fire on the scaffold, attempting to finish off all three. They think they have succeeded in their attack because Ace could not have survived being unable to use his  Devil Fruit powers. Suddenly, they see a tunnel of flame emerging from the explosion, revealing a freed Ace grabbing on to Luffy (with Mr. 3 in tow) and scolding him later on how reckless he always is.

#### Fire Fist Ace is Saved! The Final Order from a Father[]

All of Whitebeard's allies cheer on Luffy and Ace for their efforts, while the Impel Down escapees stand amazed at Luffy's feats up to that point. The Marines brace themselves to stop Ace and Luffy, who are getting ready to break through. As the Marines open fire, Ace and Luffy easily fight back against the soldiers. Whitebeard's forces try to create a path for Luffy and Ace, while the Marines continue to attempt to execute the two. Aokiji fires a mass of ice at them, which Ace blocks with an enormous wall of fire. Sengoku grumbles in disgrace that he had allowed the two to get away. Doflamingo suggests they let them get away to make things more interesting, which Vice Admiral Momonga scolds him for. Akainu swears that he will not allow any of them to leave; the Marines come across Mr. 3, who is lying exhausted from his actions.

Whitebeard's extra ship suddenly comes plowing through Marineford, being driven by Squard. Squard reveals that he wishes to stall the Marines while the others escape. Marco comments on Squard's stupidity as an ally attempts to pick the lock on the Seastone cuff around his wrist. As the ship pulls closer to the base, it screeches to a halt, and Whitebeard stops it with one hand. Whitebeard yells out that the sword wound inflicted by Squard had done nothing, as he was reaching the end of his lifespan anyway. He then says that he is about to deliver his final "Captain's orders." While his men try to talk him out of it, Whitebeard bellows out that they must part ways and that they must all return to the New World alive at all costs. He claims that he is nothing more than a remnant of an era gone by, having delivered an enormous quake into Marineford. Recalling his past when his crew asked him what he wanted if he did not desire treasure, he say that he had a long journey and was ready to settle things with the Marines.

As Marineford begins to crumble from the earthquake, the pirates persist in getting Whitebeard to come with them, but he stubbornly yells at them to leave. The Marines open fire on Whitebeard, but he continues to attack, while his crew reluctantly fulfills his wishes and proceeds to pull out. Sengoku goes to check on Garp, who rises to his feet with nothing but a bloodied forehead. Garp realizes that Whitebeard intends to end the current age of piracy before he dies. Buggy, having recovered from being frozen by Aokiji, is told by one of his followers that the Den Den Mushi has recovered. Buggy orders him to film him as he takes Whitebeard's life. The broadcast to Sabaody is renewed (though the citizens are disappointed to see only Buggy onscreen once again).

Whitebeard continues to rampage and keep the Marines at bay, and the frozen Jozu is carried aboard the ship by his fellow crewmates. Ivankov tells Luffy it is time to go. The  Straw Hat tries to get Ace to escape with him and Ace acknowledges that escaping is necessary. However, before he does, he bows to Whitebeard in the midst of the chaos. Seeing this, Whitebeard asks if he was a good father, to which Ace tearfully answers, "Of course." Whitebeard laughs heartily at the response. The rest of the pirates prepare to escape, but suddenly Akainu attacks them with a huge molten fist. He mocks Whitebeard's crew as "cowards" for grabbing Ace and running away and claims Whitebeard is nothing but a failure from a bygone era.

This strikes a chord with Ace, who turns to face him. He demands that Akainu take back what he said. The Pirate Captains and Luffy yell at Ace not to stop. Akainu continues to insult Whitebeard, claiming that since Whitebeard never defeated Roger nor became the Pirate King; he is a failure. The rest of the pirates urge Ace not to get provoked by the Admiral, but Akainu's continuing mockery eventually sets off Ace's temper. He attacks Akainu in fury, proclaiming that "The name of this era is called 'Whitebeard'!" However, he is badly burned on his left hand and knocked back, as Akainu's power is that of magma, and even though both he and Ace use  Logia fire types, magma can burn anything, even fire.

Luffy attempts to rush back to Ace's aid but falls to his knees, dropping Ace's  Vivre Card in the process. Jinbe notes that Luffy is at his limit. Unfortunately, this shifts Akainu's attention to Luffy, and he turns away from Ace to attack the younger brother. Ace, seeing that Akainu means to attack the defenseless Luffy, suddenly leaps in the way and takes the blow. Akainu's molten blow pierces Ace's entire torso. Luffy and Whitebeard's pirates look on in horror while Ace's Vivre Card burns to a scrap of paper.

#### The Sacrifice for a Younger Brother: The Flame Begins to Die Out[]

Upon seeing the fatal blow Akainu inflicted upon Ace, every pirate rushes to attack the Admiral and stop him before he can finish off Ace or Luffy. However, Akainu's Logia intangibility keeps him from being injured in the bombardment, and, noticing that Ace still has some life in him, he moves in to attack him again. Jinbe cries that he will tolerate no more of this and rushes in to take the blow with his right arm. Akainu chastises him for his actions, commenting that as a former Warlord, Jinbe would know about the power he wields. The fish-man retorts that he would gladly pay with his life to delay him, since he fully intended to die anyway. Meanwhile, Mr. 3 is dragged over to Marco, who orders him to remove the Seastone handcuffs. Sengoku and some of the other Marines realize that Garp is acting strangely; Sengoku slams him into the ground, demanding to know his intentions. As they struggle, Garp warns the Fleet Admiral that he had better keep him held tightly down or else be sure that he will murder Akainu himself.

Akainu attempts to attack Jinbe again but is interrupted by Vista and Marco, who shout at Jinbe to get down as they simultaneously attack Akainu. The Admiral is irritated by the attacks, as both Vista and Marco are Haki users. Meanwhile, Luffy catches the gravely wounded Ace as he falls and, horrified by the sight of his hand slicked with his brother's blood, begs him to hold on. Ace apologizes to Luffy for not letting him save him properly. The doctor of the Whitebeard Pirates rushes over, but Ace, knowing full well that his internal organs were badly burned from Akainu's attack, tells them it is too lateâhe can perceive his own life's end.

He goes on to remember how every person he met hated Gol D. Roger and detested the idea of his living son. If it were not for Luffy and " Sabo," he would never have wanted to live. Ace then requests that if Luffy ever meets Dadan again, to tell "that idiot" goodbye for him. His only regret is that he will never get to see Luffy's dream come true, though it undoubtedly will. He comments that he has no regrets about the path he chose in life; all he really wanted was to know the answer to one question: whether or not he should have been born. Sensing his voice is getting too quiet, he then calls out to his comrades and, with his dying breath, thanks them for loving him.

Ace smiles one last time and dies, falling from his brother's arms as the last fragment of his Vivre Card burns away.Â Luffy remembers when Ace punched him on the head in the past for crying when he thought Ace was dead, after which Ace made a promise not to die and leave his weak little brother alone. Now back in the present, kneeling by his brother's body, Luffy raises his head and howls in anguish.

The Whitebeard Pirates, along with the entire Sabaody, are shocked at the death of Ace. Luffy is unmoving and unresponsive as Ivankov calls out to him. Seeing that all the damage Luffy has received has now taken its toll, Ivankov surmises that the shock has collapsed Luffy's mind. Akainu takes the opportunity to once again try to kill Luffy, but Marco intercepts him and yells at Jinbe to take Luffy away.

Before Akainu can pursue Luffy to finish him off as well, Whitebeard, enraged at the death of Ace, appears behind him and punches Akainu to the ground, greatly wounding him. Akainu retaliates, burning off a portion of Whitebeard's head with . Unfazed, Whitebeard slams Akainu aside, injuring him further and, in the process, causing an earthquake that demolishes Marine Headquarters base and splits the plaza in half. This act separates the Marines and the pirates, isolating Whitebeard from his crew. Sengoku is astonished that Whitebeard still has so much power despite his injuries, while Whitebeard states that he is not finished yet.

The pirates, meanwhile, retreat to their ships. In the midst of the chaos, the Marines notice a shadow behind the ruined Marine Headquarters building, which reveals itself to be a giant. He is not alone; they notice more figures on the scaffolding of the building. Doflamingo laughs, while Whitebeard and Sengoku are less than pleased when they see Blackbeard and his band of pirates, which now includes a few new  crewmates recruited from Level 6 of Impel Down. Blackbeard laughs, commenting that he was glad he made it in time to see Whitebeard die. Sengoku and Blackbeard throw words at each other, and Blackbeard explains how he used the title of Warlord of the Sea to get what he wantedâto break into Impel Down and free the Level 6 prisoners  Sanjuan Wolf,  Avalo Pizarro,  Vasco Shot,  Shiryu, and  Catarina Devon.

Whitebeard and Blackbeard exchange a few words, to which Whitebeard snarls that he no longer sees Blackbeard as his son. Blackbeard, in return, says that while he really respected Whitebeard, he had gotten too old and weak and thus was unable to save Ace. He adds that it was wasteful to have spared Ace's life when he captured him at  Banaro Island. Whitebeard then attempts to punch Blackbeard with a quake punch, but Blackbeard blocks it with his . Blackbeard then asked Whitebeard how it feels to not be able to create earthquakes. Whitebeard strikes Blackbeard with his naginata, pinning him down and using his Gura Gura ability to choke Blackbeard.

As he was being choked, Blackbeard asks Whitebeard if he would kill his own son. Whitebeard seriously damages Blackbeard's skull, and Blackbeard calls him a monster, cursing him and saying that he should have been dead. He then commands his crew to kill Whitebeard. Whitebeard's sons and subordinates cry and watch in tears as their father is being killed before their eyes. While he is being attacked, Whitebeard suddenly starts remembering when Roger told him about his own death and the  true meaning of "D." After the Blackbeard Pirates run out of bullets, Whitebeard tells Blackbeard that he is not the one Roger is waiting for.

Whitebeard tells Sengoku that the bloodline of those who carry the Will of Roger still burns, and that one day, a grand battle that will engulf the whole world will begin. He goes on to say that when someone finds "that" treasure, the world will be turned upside-down. He finishes his speech by shouting to the world that the " One Piece" exists, much to Sengoku's fury.

Whitebeard once again remembers his younger days when one of his crewmates asked him what it was that he was interested in if he did not want treasure. Whitebeard's answer was "family," much to the amusement of the man who had posed the question.

After saying his final farewell to his grieving crew and distraught subordinates, Edward "Whitebeard" Newgate dies standing on his feet, after having been stabbed and slashed 267 times, shot 152 times, and hit by cannonballs 46 times. Despite his grievous wounds, when his coat falls down after his death, it will reveal his back to have been untarnished by a wound of retreat.

#### The War's Final Curtain! The End and Beginning of an Era![]

All around the world, reporters report on the demise of Ace and Whitebeard as the audience of Sabaody looks on in shock. Among the patrons is  Rayleigh, who comments on Whitebeard's death. At Marineford, this event garners different reactions from those present while Whitebeard's crew all rush for their ships. Meanwhile, the Blackbeard Pirates cover Whitebeard with a black cloth, which Blackbeard enters much to the confusion of those watching. Seeing this all finally gets to Buggy, who decides to abandon his newfound crew and run away. His followers, however, take this as a noble gesture of respect for Whitebeard's death and follow after him.

Jinbe, meanwhile, continues to carry the comatose Luffy, begging him to hang on for the sake of his late brother. Before the fish-man can reach the boats, however, the water around them is frozen due to Aokiji. If that was not bad enough, Akainu suddenly bursts from the ground, declaring once again his intention of not letting Luffy get away and demanding Jinbe hand him over. Jinbe, of course, refuses, vowing to keep Luffy alive no matter what. Ivankov suddenly appears and tells Jinbe to step aside before hitting Akainu with a .

A few Marines attack Blackbeard, but he knocks them out with darkness power. He then suddenly uses Whitebeard's earthquake power, much to the shock of everyone. When one of the pirates asks how this could be possible (as no Devil Fruit user can have two powers at once), Marco surmises that Blackbeard's body is abnormal and able to withstand the effects. Blackbeard makes a declaration of war to the entire world, claiming that it is now "his age."

As the top part of the building starts to crumble, everybody, even on Sabaody, looks in shock. As the battlefield too is starting to get uneven, the Blackbeard Pirates get further away from each other. Blackbeard asks how he should begin using his new powers, answering himself in the same moment by saying he will sink Marineford to its core. However, he is attacked by the Sengoku himself, in his Buddha form. Sengoku looks down, telling himself that they can just rebuild their base. But he tells Blackbeard that Marineford is the center of the world, and he will not let him sink it. Blackbeard challenges him to protect it.

Meanwhile, at the coast of Marineford, Akainu has made his way past Ivankov, Inazuma, and the  dancers who shoot at the Admiral. However, they are unable to harm Akainu. Akainu reaches Jinbe and tells him to hand over Dragon's son. Jinbe tries to get to the ocean, claiming he will have the advantage in the water. However, he realizes everything is ice, thanks to Aokiji. Jinbe looks back, seeing Akainu already on his heels. Akainu jumps after him, punching Jinbe to the ice. The blow goes through Jinbe and strikes Luffy, leaving an x-shaped scar on his chest.

Jinbe stands up, looking at the unconscious Luffy and apologizes for causing more damage to him. Akainu comes closer and tells Jinbe to leave Luffy there, as he has no chance of surviving. Luffy's straw hat falls to the ground. As Akainu approaches the two, he is suddenly split in half by a wave of sand.

Crocodile reveals himself and uses  to throw Luffy and Jinbe into the air, claiming that if they were going to protect Luffy, they should do it right. The duo fly until they plow into Buggy, who was still escaping, much to his surprise. His followers took it to mean that he was trying to do it deliberately to save them. Just as he is gathering himself, Akainu fires a magma fist at them but is stopped by the Whitebeard Division Commanders, who declare that they'll protect Luffy.

Buggy, meanwhile, is trying to decide where to go with Sengoku and the Blackbeard Pirates fighting on one side and Akainu and the Whitebeard Pirates on the other, during which Jinbe passes out from his wounds. He notices a  submarine surfacing from the water outside Marineford. A figure calls out to Buggy, telling him to bring Luffy to him. When asked who he is, the figure reveals himself to be  Trafalgar Law. He yells that he is there to help Luffy as he is a doctor.

The Marines notice Law and label him as Luffy's accomplice. While Law is urging Buggy to get Luffy and Jinbe on board his submarine, Buggy questions who he is once more. The Marines immediately begin attacking Law's ship. Orders are given on the ground to divide the Marines' forces to attack the Blackbeard Pirates and the Whitebeard Pirates. Meanwhile, more Marines begin emerging from trap doors that lead to underground passages. Blackbeard laughs and shakes up Marineford and the ocean around it, creating massive waves.  Jesus Burgess warns Blackbeard that they'll lose their footing if he continues on, but Blackbeard ignores him. He threatens Garp and Sengoku that he is going to "close the book" on them like he did with Whitebeard.

Meanwhile, on the Sabaody Archipelago, an announcement is made to evacuate to the north side of the Archipelago to avoid tsunamis. In the midst of the war, Koby is crying, and Helmeppo asks him why. Koby simply answers that the "voices" in his head are disappearing one by one. He notices how the Marines are continuing to attack, even after completing their original goal of executing Ace. While he is thinking this, a nearby Marine is injured. Another Marine goes to his side to help him only to be told off by Akainu, saying they do not have time to treat the injured, much to the shock of Tashigi and Smoker. Doberman commands the Marines to beat every last pirate down; Akainu once more states that they cannot allow the "evil known as pirates" to exist.

Blackbeard is seen laughing some more, claiming that he will destroy everything. Elsewhere, while Buggy is flying in the air, he notices a gleam of light as Kizaru shoots another laser beam in his direction. Fearing for his life, Buggy hurls Jinbe and Luffy at the deck of Law's submarine.  Bepo commands  Jean Bart to grab them. Kizaru commends Law for escaping from him during the incident at Sabaody Archipelago and is about to attack him until a shout is heard. The shouting is revealed to be coming from Koby, who yells for everyone to stop fighting since the Marines have families waiting for them and lives are being wasted. He yells at how the Marines already accomplished their goal, how they are chasing pirates who do not wish to fight, desiring war, and abandoning injured Marines while they could be treated, finishing his speech with how any Marine that falls at this point is foolish. Akainu simply tells Koby that seconds have been wasted, and that the Marines do not need someone like this, and he gets ready to kill him.

Before Akainu can strike Koby, out of nowhere, Shanks interferes, blocking Akainu's magma fist with his sword. He tells Koby that his few seconds of courage, for which he was willing to throw away his life, have changed the fate of the world. Law takes this opportunity to hurry up and escape. Kizaru is about to attack again when he is stopped by  Benn Beckman, who threatens to shoot Kizaru if he "moves a muscle." Shanks picks up his straw hat that Luffy had dropped and says that he has arrived to put an end to the war.

The Marines loudly exclaim at the arrival of the  Red Hair Pirates, as they wonder how Shanks' recent encounter with  Kaidou the day before ended so quickly and how he was able to arrive at Marineford so quickly. Shanks then calls Buggy to give Luffy his straw hat, and in return, Shanks will give him a treasure map. Buggy quickly complies and heads towards Trafalgar Law's submarine, giving Law the straw hat.

Lucky Roux then asks Shanks if he is sure he does not want to see Luffy again, since it has been ten years since they last met, showing flashbacks of Shanks giving Luffy his straw hat. Shanks then answers, saying he would love to see Luffy again, but if he saw him now, that would violate their agreement. Akainu curses Shanks' name as Aokiji attempts to freeze the submarine over with . Kizaru then decides to attack using , while the submarine attempts to dive to escape Kizaru's attack. Kizaru then decides that if the  Heart Pirates, Luffy, and Jinbe survive the attack, the Marines should just let them go and say they got lucky. Worried, Boa Hancock comandeers a Marine ship and gives orders to chase the submarine, under the pretense that she intends to finish off Luffy herself.

Buggy yells at Shanks for lying about the treasure map, with Shanks justifying his lie by saying it was a spur of the moment decision, while Buggy continues to yell at Shanks, clearly holding his grudge. Buggy's followers comically admire Buggy's attitude towards Shanks, continuing to swear loyalty to him. Buggy then thinks that if he stays with the Red Hair Pirates, he will be able to get off the island safely. Shanks then orders Marco to withdraw in order to stop encouraging the battle. While this happens, Mihawk walks away, telling the Marines that he was only told to participate in the war against Whitebeard and that fighting Shanks is not part of the agreement. Shanks threatens the Marines, saying that if there are any others who wish to fight, then he and his crew will fight them. Upon asking Blackbeard, Teach quickly decides to postpone their battle, satisfied with getting what he came for, and leaves shortly thereafter.

Shanks then tells the remaining Whitebeard Pirates and the Marines to allow him to save face, with the Whitebeard Pirates mourning the losses of Ace and Whitebeard and the Marines appearing indifferent. The Pacifista stop, with the Warlords and the Marines also ceasing their attacks. Shanks then tells the Marines that they will take Whitebeard and Ace's bodies, as he will not allow their deaths to become a spectacle to the world. The Marines ask Sengoku what to do. Sengoku quietly agrees to Shanks' demands and tells them that he will take responsibility for the repercussions. He orders the Marines to tend to the wounded, and Shanks gives his thanks. With this, the " Summit War of Marineford," known as the greatest war of the Great Age of Pirates, has ended.

### __Post-War Arc__

#### One Era Ends, Another Begins: The Aftermath of Whitebeard's Death[]

All across the world, civilians rejoice that the Marines emerged victorious in the  Summit War of Marineford.  The Eleven Supernovas, having all assembled at  Marineford to take part in the battle (viewing it from a safe distance), realize that  Whitebeard has been killed and all of them take their own separate actions.  Eustass Kid claims that the  Emperor's death (now consisting of only  Shanks,  Kaidou, and  Big Mom), has caused the balance of the  Three Great Powers to crumble, and the world is about to enter an age like nothing ever seen before.

The world reacts in different ways to Whitebeard's death.  Pirates celebrate that Whitebeard's claimed that the  One Piece definitely exists. Civilians and  Marines cheer that Whitebeard is dead. A band of ferocious pirates, under the helm of the self-proclaimed " Brownbeard", attacks the town of  Foodvalten, which was formerly protected by Whitebeard. Even though the Marines were triumphant, their victory has inevitably brought nothing but chaos.

Hancock, having traced  Law's submarine through  Salome, turns the Marines on her ship to stone and inquires about  Luffy's condition.  Law informs Hancock that Luffy's life is preserved for the moment but that he is in critical condition. At that moment, the  Impel Down prisoners, led by  Ivankov, arrive in a stolen Marine ship.

The  Newkama Land citizens cheer that they will finally be able to head forth to the  Kamabakka Kingdom now that the war is over, and they are finally free. Ivankov informs Hancock of the trials he had to endure in escaping Impel Down, and how the death of  Ace would crush anyone's mind. This prompts Hancock to muse to herself, wishing that she could have instead been in Luffy's place. When Ivankov asks Law why he saved Luffy, he claims that he had no obligation, and Ivankov understands that he had done it without thinking.

Jinbe emerges from the submarine, thanking Law for saving his life. Although Ivankov tells him to rest, he says that he cannot, for his heart is in too much turmoil. He worries not about Luffy's current condition, but rather more about what will happen when he awakens. Hancock demands that  Bepo give her a  Den Den Mushi so she can call the  Kuja Pirates to carry them across the  Calm Belt to  Amazon Lily. There, Luffy should be able to recover without possible discovery by the Marines.

At the destroyed Marineford,  Sengoku is informed by  Brannew that  Magellan had been beaten to an inch of his life. Upon reaching  Level 6: Eternal Hell,  Blackbeard had instructed the prisoners in each cage to engage in a battle for life and death, and the winners would be set free. Although Blackbeard only took four prisoners with him, there were many Level 6 prisoners that went missing, having escaped during the chaos. Although Sengoku demands that wanted posters of the escaped criminals be sent throughout the world, Brannew claims that the  World Government has chosen to hide the information of the Level 6 prisoners' escape lest the world lose trust in the World Government, a decision which enrages Sengoku.

Elsewhere on Marineford,  Donquixote Doflamingo and the  Pacifista are beating  Gecko Moria to death. Doflamingo claims that the government has decided that he is too weak to be a  Warlord of the Sea, and that it would be better if he was thought to be "killed in the war" rather than eliminated by the government. Moria asks if Sengoku is behind the decision, but Doflamingo claims that the decision was made by powers even higher than him.

Two weeks later, the aftereffects of the war are still taking hold. In the town of  Las Camp in the  West Blue, a new pirate crew has formed, and its captain proclaims that they will head to the  Grand Line. While the Marines are trying to stop them, new pirate crews are being formed all around the world.

After Ivankov and the Newkama leave on the stolen Marine ship to sail back to the Kamabakka Kingdom, Luffy, Hancock, Jinbe, and the  Heart Pirates all return to Amazon Lily. The Heart Pirates are given special permission to land on a small beach on the island but are forbidden from going elsewhere. Luffy has woken up and is now desperately trying to convince himself that Ace's death was but a dream. He goes on a rampage, with the Heart Pirates unable to calm him. Law comments that if Luffy does not calm down soon, his wounds will open up and certainly kill him.

At the central palace in Amazon Lily, Hancock is ecstatic to hear that Luffy is awake once more. She wishes to see him at once, though Elder  Nyon prevents this as she sees such an action as a bad example to her subjects, and that allowing the Heart Pirates to even be on the island was a special exception already.  Hancock's  sisters, remembering that she had not eaten since she returned, tell her to eat, but only convince her to prepare a feast for Luffy so that he can recover. Nyon says that once Luffy is at full strength, she will allow him to see Hancock. Nyon thinks about both Hancock's strengthening " Love Sickness" and Luffy's incredible survival, going through both Impel Down and Marineford.

Back at the Heart Pirates' camp, the crew members discuss the women of the island and wish that they could go past their boundary to see them. Sitting on a rock not too far from them is Law, who is looking at the  straw hat he has in his hand with a curious look.

Luffy finally calms down after recalling everything that had happened to him right before he fainted and finally accepts that he was not dreaming. Jinbe watches over him, remembering that he promised Ace that if he died, he would protect him. Luffy cries out to Jinbe, askingÂ him if Ace died, which Jinbe confirms, making Luffy cry even harder. Jinbe begins to tear up at the sight of Luffy's grief.

#### Flashback: Dawn Island[]

Ten years ago, on the road to  Mt. Colubo on  Dawn Island,  Garp brings a young Luffy to be raised by  Curly Dadan, who has already been raising Ace since his birth, ten years before the flashback. Luffy, who had already met Shanks and obtained his  Gomu Gomu no Mi, is angry at his grandfather since he has already made up his mind to become the Pirate King, much to Garp's dismay, as he wishes for Luffy and Ace to become great Marines. After knocking on Dadan's door in her large house in the forest, Dadan, a large bandit woman, and two of  her henchmen step out of the door. Dadan complains about how much of a hassle Ace is, and that she can barely handle him. To her surprise, Garp tells her that he is entrusting her with Luffy. She claims that she could not possibly raise both Luffy and Ace, but Garp reminds her that he knows all about her illegal activities and that if she refused, he would turn her and her men in. She then changed her mind and accepted it with anger. Suddenly, Luffy is attacked with a ball of spit. He turns to see who it came from and sees Ace for the first time. Although Garp tells both Ace and Luffy to get along, the two stare at each other with a seeming hatred.

Luffy is left with the bandits and quickly shows his disdain for them due to his previous encounter not too long ago. The bandits sit down to eat, and Luffy complains about the small portion he has gotten compared to Ace's, who gets a bigger share. Dadan explains that since Ace had slain the buffalo, he got the bigger meat, and that Luffy should count himself lucky that Ace is sharing with them. Dadan then tries to take advantage of Luffy and makes him her servant, but her attempts backfire due to Luffy's simple-minded nature. Ace heads off on his own, with Luffy following after him. Luffy tells him that he forgives him for spitting on him earlier and tries to be his friend. Ace, however, ignores him and knocks down a tree to prevent Luffy from following him.

Luffy manages to break through and continues after Ace on a rope bridge. Annoyed, Ace knocks him off into the chasm below. Ace returns to the mountain bandits and claims he does not know where Luffy is when asked, which Dadan roughly shrugs off as not being her responsibility. A week later, Luffy returns to the cabin, battered but alive. When asked what happened, Luffy claims to have been chased off a cliff by wolves. The next day, Ace heads off on his own again, and Luffy tags along behind him. Ace would venture out and Luffy would try to follow him, each time with Luffy ending up in one dangerous situation after another, which Ace would purposely lead Luffy into.

After an unknown periodÂ of time, Luffy eventually managed to follow Ace out of the forest and into a junkyard area of the island known as " The Gray Terminal," where there is no law, no doctors, and where many homeless and dangerous individuals roam. Making his way through the junkyard, Luffy finds Ace with a boy of his own age named  Sabo. Ace shows Sabo some money he snagged off people at the front gate of the area when he came in, and it is revealed that the two are collecting money for a pirate ship. Luffy overhears the two and tries to get the duo to let him join them. However, they tie him to a tree and, after pondering what to do with him, agree to just kill him.

Luffy's yelling attracts attention to the trio and they hide as the  Bluejam Pirates arrive, led by a man named  Porchemy. His subordinates reveal that it was they whom Ace had stolen the money from. At first, it seemed the three managed to hide before he spotted them, but Luffy somehow ended up near them and was captured. Porchemy threatens him but Luffy claims he does not know anything about the money, though his expression statesÂ otherwise, and he accidentally gives away Ace's name. Porchemy then carries Luffy off, stating he will make him talk, as Ace and Sabo look on in horror.

The pirates take Luffy back to their hideout. Luffy, however, yells that he will not tell them anything. Porchemy tries to kill Luffy with a giant mallet, but due to his Gomu Gomu no Mi, it just bounces off Luffy. Porchemy then switches to spiked boxing gloves, which indeed penetrate Luffy's defenses. Porchemy then has the others go search for Ace and Sabo as he tries to get Luffy to talk. Meanwhile, the said boys have started moving their hidden funds, scared that the pirates will come looking for them when Luffy breaks. As they do that, the pirates ask around the junkyard for any info on Ace and Sabo, but no one gives them anything useful. Sunset comes and the two boys have managed to move their loot successfully. Sabo, who went to see how Luffy was doing, rushes back and informs Ace that Luffy had not told the pirates where the money was. Not far from their location, the leader of the pirates, Captain  Bluejam, himself, grows impatient when his money is not found. Back with Porchemy and Luffy, the former savagely roughs up Luffy to get him to cough up the information. One of the pirates tries to get Porchemy to lay off as Luffy is being beaten to the point where he can no longer say anything. Even those outside the building feel sympathy for Luffy but comment that no law official will come to that part of the island, even with the murder that happens every now and then.

Despite all the abuse he's taken, Luffy steadfastly refuses to rat out Ace. Porchemy, tired of getting nowhere, proceeds to killÂ him. Ace and Sabo suddenly burst into the hideout, which the pirates instantly recognized as they were the ones that took their money. Porchemy grabs Ace, but Sabo saves him by knocking Porchemy down. He then grabs a knife, cuts Luffy free, and runs away, yelling at Ace to do so as well. However, Ace decides to stay behind, citing that when he faces an enemy he does not run. Sabo runs back to aid him and the two fight against Porchemy. In the end, the two come out victorious, and Porchemy later faces the wrath of Captain Bluejam, who kills him for his failure. Back in the forest, Sabo scolds Ace for his stubbornness, and Ace scolds Luffy who is crying his eyes out after the encounter. Luffy thanks the two before Ace asks Luffy why he did not talk when he was being tortured. Luffy respondsÂ that he would not have Ace as a friend anymore and that he did not have anyone on the island to rely on since he could not go back to  Foosha Village and he does not trust bandits. Moreover, he does not wish to be alone. Ace, thinking back to when he was mocked by those that hated  Gol D. Roger, realizes he is in the same boat. As Luffy and he begin to bicker over pointless things, Sabo realizes that the pirates will come looking for them. Thus, he invites himself to live with Dadan, much to her annoyance. Since then, Ace, Sabo, and Luffy hang out together in the forest, fighting any beast, bandit, or pirate that gets in their way. One day, while they were out, Dadan picked up a newspaper and found out some shocking news,  Celestial Dragons were coming to the island for some unknown reason.

The boys are unaware of this and continue training and running around the mountain, getting stronger day by day. Beyond the Gray Terminal is an area known as the Great Gate, which is part of a wall that surrounds another area called the  Goa Kingdom. Foosha Village is also part of this kingdom, though it is largely forgotten due to the mountains around the area. The Kingdom is divided into sections. The Edge Town, which is still near the Gray Terminal, has buildings and is home to delinquents and vagrants. The Town Center is where the middle-class lives and, in the center, guarded by another high wall, is the High Town, where the royals and nobles live. It is said to be the most beautiful country in the  East Blue, though it is segregated due to the class system.

The three boys sneak past the Great Wall one day during the trash dumping of the Gray Terminal into the Town Center and pull a dine and dash, escaping out the window of a diner and running from the guards. However, one of the citizens recognizes Sabo and calls out to him, but Sabo just ignores the man. Once back in the forest, Ace and Luffy demand to know if he is keeping anything from them. After some goading, Sabo comes clean and reveals he is actually a noble who ran away from home.

The reason for this was that his parents always pressured him and were more concerned about their financial and social security thanÂ him, making Sabo feel like a burden and alone in the world; hence his desire to become a pirate, as he wished to feel free from their overbearing rule and write a book about their adventures. Ace and Luffy agree wholeheartedly, the former wanting to do it for acknowledgement and the latter, of course, wanting to be Pirate King, though Ace and Sabo are skeptical of it. Regardless, Ace pullsÂ out some alcohol and pours them into sake cups, declaring they were brothers from that day forward.

From day to day, they kept getting stronger; fighting pirates, taking baths together, eating together, saving one another during their trips across the mountains; fighting against the wild animals of the forest; getting visited by Garp and beaten senseless; and building their own tree house and living in it; and generally, just acting like boys their age should.  Makino and  Woop Slap regularly pass by and drop off new clothes for the bunch.

But one day,  Sabo's father found them and, with the assistance of the Bluejam Pirates, captured the three, with Sabo's father claiming Ace and Luffy lured him away from home. Just as the pirates were about to beat Ace and Luffy, Sabo willingly decided to go back with his father to save them, though with great reluctance. Ace and Luffy could do nothing more but beg him to stay as he was led away.

While Luffy and Ace are once again in the custody of the Bluejam Pirates, Bluejam reveals that he wished he was born a  Noble, and that if they are truly brothers, they will not return after Sabo. Luffy and Ace join the Bluejam Pirates at the request of the captain, and then carry cargo to marked locations in Gray Terminal with other pirates. Meanwhile, Sabo, accompanied by his father, is being questioned about the crimes he has committed. His father urges him to place all the blame on Luffy and Ace to save his family's name. However, Sabo refuses and is hit to the ground, and his father is forced to bribe the officer.

Sabo returns home with his father and is greeted by his mother and newly adopted brother,  Sterry. Sterry tells Sabo that Gray Terminal will be burned to an ash along with its inhabitants, and that this has been planned for months in accordance with the arrival of the Inspection Unit and Celestial Dragon. Sabo escapes from the family manor at night and overhears a group of Royal Guards discussing the plan. In their discussion, it is revealed to Sabo that the burning of Gray Terminal will proceed tomorrow and that the Bluejam Pirates will be behind the act.

The next day, Sabo escapes the manor and travels the streets of High Town, only to find that all the nobles are aware of the massacre. His father sends out a search party, and soon Sabo is given chase by two Royal Guards. Meanwhile, Bluejam reveals to Luffy and Ace that the cargo they had carried was oil and gunpowder, and that Gray Terminal would be set alight that day. Luffy and Ace react in outrage and are quickly apprehended by Bluejam's underlings. Bluejam informs them that they can no longer be left alive, then asks where their "likely" hoard of treasure is located.

Later that night, the inhabitants of Edge Town, the Town Center, and Mt. Colubo all bear witness as the monstrous inferno rages. The Royal Guards usher the citizens of Edge Town into the Town Center, while the inhabitants of Gray Terminal flee in terror, only to find that every exit is blocked by the blaze. The Bluejam Pirates stand at the Great Gate of Goa surrounded by fire, as it is revealed that they will receive titles from the King, become nobles, and live in High Town as payment for their services. However, the gate will not open for the pirates, as Bluejam realizes that their bargain has been betrayed, and they have been left to die.

Meanwhile, Luffy and Ace manage to cut themselves loose after being bound to a tree, whilst surrounded by the encroaching flames. In the Town Center, a rumor had circulated amongst citizens that the Bluejam Pirates were responsible for the atrocity, in an attempt to halt the Inspection Unit and the Celestial Dragon from visiting the island. Sabo is chased by the Royal Guards and is noted as being the last citizen remaining in Edge Town. While running, he crashes and falls to the ground, to be aided by an unknown cloaked person. In a frenzy, Sabo tells the person about the atrocity that the nobles had concocted and that he is ashamed of having been born a noble.

It is revealed that the cloaked individual is none other than  Dragon, as he informs Sabo that he feels he understands as he too was born in Goa Kingdom. Dragon then follows by saying that he still lacked the power to change it and would listen to and remember Sabo's story at the boys' behest. Luffy and Ace are seen fleeing from engulfing flames, as an individual wearing high heels informs Dragon that preparations have been made.

Meanwhile, Bluejam and his crew are still at the gate. The pirate captain remembers the King of Goa promising him he would make Bluejam and his crew nobles for carrying out the trash-burning job. The shock of being betrayed hits Bluejam hard as he watches his ship catch fire and burn down. He and his crew are now trapped in the same fire they started. At the palace, a noble girl asks her father why they are burning Trash Mountain and the people inside. The father responds that it is because the people there were not born nobles, to which the daughter agrees. Back at the Gray Terminal, the residents are still trying to find a way out of the fire, among them being Luffy and Ace, who are not having any luck. If that was not bad enough, Bluejam finds them and has them restrained, despite protests from the boys that they should worry about escaping. Bluejam once more inquiries about the money Ace and Sabo hid, commenting that their efforts will go to waste if the fire gets it. Ace, though hesitant, agrees with Bluejam and tells them where the treasure is. Nonetheless, Bluejam continues to keep them in captivity in case they were lying since Sabo is their friend, and Bluejam's newfound hatred of nobles has him thinking Sabo was just using Ace and Luffy to make himself look superior. These comments anger Luffy and Ace, the former of whom bites the pirate holding him. Luffy is attacked and is wounded as a result.

Just as the pirates are about to kill Luffy, Ace shouts at them to stop unwittingly unleashing  Haki and causing the pirates save for Bluejam to faint. Bluejam attacks Ace but is stopped by the arrival of Dadan and her band of bandits. They grab the boys and prepare to run, but Ace once again refuses to and faces down Bluejam. Dadan decides to stay with Ace while the rest of the bandits get Luffy to safety on her orders. Meanwhile, the rest of the residents of Trash Mountain are still trapped with nowhere left to run. As all seems lost, a pathway appears out of nowhere to the ocean and a boat. The residents quickly take it while those on the boat, revealed to be Dragon and his  Revolutionaries (among whom are Iva and  Kuma), wait for them. Iva is astonished that Dragon found out what was going to happen in the kingdom and questions if Dragon has an attachment to the place. Dragon answers that the island is nothing more than a blueprint for the world's future and that there is no happiness in a world that views people as "useless". He then vows to change the world and offers any of the trash mountain residents who are willing to fight to come with him.

Meanwhile, the bandits manage to escape, but a caption comes up revealing that Ace and Dadan did not return as the Gray Terminal continues to burn. The next day, Luffy tries to go out and search for Ace and Dadan, but the bandits tell him that his wounds are still recovering. Plus, the soldiers of Goa are "cleaning up" after the fire, including any survivors in the area. At the Gray Terminal, the guards are doing just that, though they remark that there are not as many corpses as they thought there would be, shrugging it off that they burned in the fire. News of Bluejam's boat burning reaches Sabo's ears, whose father comments that it is futile for Sabo to run and that he should just listen to his parents' orders and make them proud. Sabo ignores him and thinks of Luffy and Ace, wondering if they are okay before pondering what the true meaning of freedom is.

The day of the Celestial Dragon's arrival comes, and the Goa Kingdom prepares for the event. However, the kingdom spots a fishing ship out in the ocean with a child sailing it, and the residents panic, worried that it will ruin the ceremony. It is revealed to be Sabo at the helm who prepares to sail off from the kingdom. The kingdom's residents try to get Sabo to turn back, but he ignores them, unaware that one of Dadan's crew,  Dogra, is in the crowd who instantly recognizes him. Sabo, meanwhile, comments that his greatest fear is getting caught up in the country and becoming a different person, and he refuses to turn around.

At that instance, the Government ship carrying the Celestial Dragon arrives. Seeing it, Sabo tries to move out of its path while those on board spot him. The crowd at the kingdom cheers as they arrive, and even Sabo marvels at how big the ship is. However, the Celestial Dragon onboard pulls out a hand-held cannon and fires on Sabo's ship, setting it ablaze.

Back at the bandits' hideout, Luffy tries once more to go search for Ace and Dadan, but the bandits refuse to let him do so due to him still healing. They tell Luffy they know how he feels and that they sent Dogra to go check out the grounds. Back at the ceremony, the crowd looks on in shock as Sabo's boat continues to burn. A servant tells the Celestial Dragon, Saint  Jalmack, that there was a child on the ship. But Jalmack comments that if he raised a  pirate flag then it did not matter, but he is angrier at the fact that a commoner crossed his path. Sabo, meanwhile, tries to put out the flames of his ship, but Jalmack fires again and this time sinks the boat, presumably killing Sabo as well. The crowd continues to look on in horror at this turn of events while the officials order the ship's remains to be cleaned up so as not to upset the Celestial Dragon any further. Back at the hideout, Ace suddenly arrives carrying Dadan, both bruised and burned but still alive, much to the joy of everyone, especially Luffy who hugs Ace who in turn bops him on the head for crying about him.

Ace then explains that they managed to beat Bluejam but their escape route got cut off. Dadan got burns on her body, but the duo managed to escape into the middle forest. They hid in the riverbank until everything died down, at which point Ace stole some medicine from the town to keep Dadan alive. Dadan is then patched up and set down to rest as the day goes on. Dadan asks why Ace did not run, to which he explains that he was afraid if he did, he'd lose something important to him, in this case, Luffy. Dadan soon realizes the similarities between him and Roger, as she remembers Garp explaining that Roger was the same way, not running because he was fearless but rather to keep the enemy from following after his crewmates. It was this trust that convinced Garp to take care of Ace in secret.

Dogra returns and Luffy tells him of the good news about Dadan and Ace coming back. However, this joy is short-lived as Dogra tells the others what happened to Sabo. Ace attacks him instantly, thinking it's a lie, but Dogra, being a rogue, knows what it's like not to want to return to some place they do not want to. Luffy begins to cry again, and Ace starts to blame himself for not going back to get Sabo. He yells at Dogra to tell him who killed Sabo and starts to run off. Dadan pins him to the floor, telling him that Sabo's enemy was the whole country, and he did not have the power to take fight against it. If he does it now, that he will just die and be forgotten and that if Ace wants to change the world, he must get strong enough to do so like his father. She then has the bandits tie Ace to a tree as he keeps struggling while Luffy continues to cry. Morning comes, and Ace has cooled down when the bandits come to check on him. A letter bird arrives with a message from Sabo to Luffy and Ace. The bandits cut Ace free so he could read it, which he does as he walks back to the cliff where they made their bond. The letter starts off with Sabo worrying about their safety but believing they are alright. He then explains that he is going out to sea, anywhere away from the country, and hopes to become stronger and freer than any pirate on the sea. He then closes out by asking Ace to take care of their younger brother, Luffy. As Ace finishes the letter, he cannot help but cry for his fallen friend.

Luffy is lying with his face on the ground on the cliff where Ace read Sabo's letter. He is crying, and Ace punches him in the head, scolding him for his behavior, saying that their hidden treasure is gone, and that there is no point in having treasure if it cannot be protected. Luffy tearfully cries out his will to become stronger in order to protect the ones he loves, and then begs Ace to survive, to which he takes another punch. Ace then promises him that he will not die since he has a weak little brother to take care of. He says that what killed Sabo was the "opposite of freedom", and that the two remaining brothers must obtain freedom and become pirates, even if that means making a lot of enemies, even Garp. The two then agreed to set sail on their 17th year and become pirates, as Sabo told them that children born from noble families obtain their title at 18 years old and wanted to leave Goa at 17. On that night, the Celestial Dragon reached the Goa Kingdom: there are two brief scenes of  Zoro's and  Kuina's training, and then, in a small, unnamed port town in East Blue, Dragon is boarding on his ship, apologizing for his delay, asking for the conditions of an undetermined "him" and being told about the supplies being restocked. He then orders his men to set sail for  Baltigo.

As months pass, the Gray Terminal is being reconstructed. Ace and Luffy are training again, and the rubber boy is trying to develop his  technique but ends up hitting himself, to which Ace laughs and remarks that rubber is not for fighting. The two start arguing over the utility of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, but are interrupted by the one they think is Sabo, but in reality, it is nothing else than rock: they are just remembering their beloved brother. Luffy states that Sabo was really a good brother, to which Ace angrily replies in a comical way, asking his brother if he wanted him to die instead. They return to Dadan's hideout and build two rudimentary shacks which they name "Ace's country" and "Luffy's country," much to Dadan's surprise, as they want to survive alone and get stronger. Following this, the two adventure in the jungle, and Luffy runs across a fierce bear. Ace refuses to help him, because they must grow stronger alone, but when the animal severely injures Luffy off-screen, he desperately cries for him. He managed to bring Luffy back to the Bandit hideout, where the rubber boy was being treated by Dogra. Ace huddles up on the wall, saying to Luffy that he is sorry. Sometime later, Makino pays a visit to Ace, and he tells her of his intentions to meet Red-Haired Shanks and introduce himself to the man who once saved his brother's life. Ace is annoyed because Makino keeps smiling.

Ace and Luffy are then seen escaping from a restaurant's owner after eating without paying the check (an attitude Ace will show again in the future) and once again having training. They fight and defeat a bear, then chase punks and fight a giant insect. Garp is seen again, one more time, beating up his grandsons. The two "brothers" are seen together one more time, and happily jumping from a building.

Seven years later, Ace, at age 17, is finally setting sail: he is on a little boat with a triangular sail and sports many of his trademark objects: his hat with the two smiles, the orange belt with his initial on the buckle, the armband on the left arm, and his green bag with a black pattern on it. He happily says goodbye to the ones at the shore; Luffy, who is now 14, Makino, Woop Slap, Dogra,  Magra, and the other bandits, who wish him good luck in return. Dadan was not there as she remained in her hideout. Her subordinates inform her that Ace is already gone. She appears to remain unmoved upon hearing it, claiming that Garp will be angry, and that Ace is always causing trouble. However, as her bandits tell her that Ace sent her a message, "Thank you," she burst out in tears, showing her sadness.

We now get to see Luffy, who is trying his  move again, this time against a rock. Finally, he shows off his capabilities, shattering the rock to pieces with his mighty rubber punch. He rejoices, having gotten stronger. He then receives a visit from Dogra, who shows him a newspaper: it is Ace, his crew, and his ship, already famous. The rubber boy is happy and states that he will not let Ace surpass him.

Three more years pass, and finally, at 17 years old, Luffy is ready to set sail himself. He says goodbye to the Bandits, who cannot go to Foosha Village because of its civilians. He thanks them, and then tells Dadan that he dislikes mountain bandits, to which she gets angry and shouts at him, but when the boy says that he likes them instead, the woman bursts out in tears, as she did three years before for Ace's departure. Luffy is then seen on a dinghy in Foosha Village. One of the citizens asks him to take one of their old fishing boats, but the boy refuses, content with his little boat. He then cries Sabo's name, telling his deceased brother of his departure. After saying farewell to his friends, he sets sail, and he rapidly defeats the King of the Coast off-screen, a feat commented on by Dadan, Dogra, and Magra, hidden behind a wall.

#### Moving Past Mourning: Luffy Gets Back on His Feet[]

Time returns to the present, where Luffy is still crying over Ace's death before Jinbe. He expresses doubt for the first time about his dream of being the Pirate King, exclaiming he is weak.

Garp returns to Luffy's hometown only to hear that Makino's bar has been over-run by vicious mountain bandits. Those mountain bandits ended up being Dadan and her underlings. Dadan sees Garp and hits him with a wooden bat. Makino steps between Dadan and Garp before she can attack again. Makino then states that "Garp could not save both Ace and Luffy even if he wanted to" and "Garp is the one truly suffering." But as soon as she says that, Dadan says, with tears in her eyes, that the one truly suffering the most is Luffy. Makino then remembers the very first time she met Ace and runs off in a face full of tears. As soon as she leaves, Garp states that Luffy is aliveâfor now. The final words that come out of Dadan's mouth are that she will always support Luffy no matter what he does from that point forward and that he better not lose no matter what.

Meanwhile, on an island in the  New World, the  Whitebeard and  Red Hair Pirate crews bid a final farewell to Edward Newgate and Portgas D. Ace at their funeral, where  Marco thanks Shanks for everything he has done for him and his crew. Shanks states that although he was an enemy, he deserved their respect and even Sengoku's as well. With that said, Shanks and his crew leave silently. In his mind, Shanks says to Luffy that he must move on by relieving his emotions and crying everything out, even if he is a man.

Jinbe tells Luffy to stop beating himself up over Ace's actions, but Luffy refuses and tries to punch him but misses. Jinbe then pins Luffy to the ground where Luffy bites him, and Jinbe finally gets mad at Luffy and pins him to a rock. There he says that right now his thoughts and path are over-shadowed by grief, but someday he will find something he will never stop fighting for. At that point, he lets Luffy go, and Luffy takes a while to think. When he finally reaches his answer, his face is drowned in tears and he admits that he still has his loyal and faithful crew and that he wants to go back to them as soon as possible, no matter what.

Meanwhile, the Heart Pirates spot something that kills a  Sea King, which then lands on the island near them. The person reveals himself to be  Rayleigh, much to their surprise, even more so when he makes it known he knows Luffy is on the island too. Hancock, along with her sisters and Nyon, come to bring Luffy food just as Luffy and Jinbe meet up with Rayleigh. The duo also notices how the Heart Pirates have left, which Rayleigh tells Luffy that Law said to take it easy for two more weeks. Hancock's bunch soon arrive at the group's location, much to Nyon's surprise when she spots Rayleigh, revealing the Boas know him. Luffy and Jinbe begin to eat (though Jinbe was only allowed a little food due to Hancock) while Rayleigh delivers a letter to the Boas from  Shakky, which reveals that they know her as well due to the fact that she once lived on the island. Rayleigh also mentions how he figured out Luffy's location thanks to Kuma after the battle on  Sabaody, as well as Shakky's intuition after the Marineford War.

Rayleigh asks Luffy if he is planning on returning to Sabaody, which Luffy confirms. However, Rayleigh mentions that if they go back, the whole incident could start all over again. He then says he has a plan and it's up to Luffy if he wants to go along with it.

#### The Crew in a Panic[]

On the island of  Boin Archipelago,  Usopp, now fat from eating the island's natural food, is trying to fight his way past a giant horned beetle despite the pleas of his companion,  Heracles. He gets knocked down and Heracles mentions that the further out from the island you go, the tougher the creatures are, making it impossible to escape. Usopp, on the other hand, does not listen and takes off again just as the Sea Kings, distracted by the smell of the island, begin to arrive. Heracles notices the island beginning to move and warns Usopp to cling to something, as we find out the island is actually one large carnivorous plant called the  Stomach Baron. Usopp is nearly eaten, but Heracles saves him and asks what is wrong, having noticed that Usopp changed after he read a newspaper dropped by a newspaper bird. Usopp answers that he found out about Ace's death and is trying desperately to get off the island to help Luffy through his pain; otherwise, he could not call himself a member of  Luffy's crew.

Meanwhile, in the  Torino Kingdom,  Chopper helps the natives and the  birds of the island get along. It turns out the reason the birds have been attacking the natives was because they thought they were stealing their eggs. In actuality, the natives just wanted plants near their trees. He is set to leave after having found out what happened to Ace and wishing to get off the island to treat Luffy. Bidding the island's residents farewell, Chopper heads off on one of the birds. They pass a newspaper bird and Chopper grabs a paper from it. However, he finds something about Luffy in the paper and begins to panic.

On  Kuraigana Island, which we find out is the home of  Mihawk, who has returned and is reading the newspaper about Moria's supposed death, which causes  Perona to cry, although Mihawk doubts the credibility of the article. Meanwhile, Zoro is fighting against  humandrills that somehow know swordplay and is having a tough time reaching the ocean. Mihawk appears and notices the boat he gave him to get off the island has been trashed. When asked why he is in such a rush, Zoro reveals he found out about the battle at Marineford as well. However, Mihawk tells him that 7 years ago, war broke out over the island and the humandrills learned their skills from the people that fought it and grew strong over the years. Mihawk offers Zoro a place to rest at his castle, but Zoro roughly refuses his offer and continues to try to leave the island.

On  Weatheria,  Nami has been thrown into a small prison for trying to steal a weather ball and some weather knots the people were using for research.  Haredas comes by to help her and asks why her mood suddenly changed, showing that, like the other members, she too found out about what happened to Luffy and Ace. She begins to cry and break down, earning the resident's pity. As soon as they release her, Nami, in the blink of an eye, grabs Haredas and the objects that were confiscated from her and is already a good distance away from her captors. Realizing they've been tricked, they set after her while Nami runs and tells Haredas to just drop her anywhere. All the while, she is thinking of Luffy and hoping he will be alright. Haredas points out to Nami that her crocodile tears have not stopped running, but Nami just tells him to shut up.

In the snow kingdom of  Baldimore,  Franky finds himself being chased by marines and cyborg animals as he makes his way through  Vegapunk's old laboratory. He is unable to defend himself since neither he nor his pursuers wish to damage the place, considering it a "treasure". Recalling the conversation, he had with a  young boy and his grandfather, they reveal that Vegapunk created a heating system in the form of a mountain to help the island. However, it is incomplete due to the fact that while Vegapunk had the blueprints, he did not have the money or resources to finish it. The old man then warns Franky not to enter the lab, but Franky, having also heard the news of what happened to Luffy, is in need of an ice-breaking ship, and Vegapunk's lab seems to be the only place to find one.

In the present, Franky comes across a few blueprints and is impressed by their contents. He also comes across the self-destruct switch, which the old man also warned him about. Franky mistakes the skull and crossbones design on it as a pirate symbol and presses it, causing the whole lab to explode. This incident soon reached around the world and was dubbed " The Nightmare of Baldimore."

Meanwhile, on the island of  Namakura in the poor country of  Harahettania, we find that  Brook and the residents of the island have managed to imprison the  Longarm Tribe, thanks to Brook's music, which helped them gain the courage to take them on. Brook congratulates the islanders on their success but secretly finds out about what happened at Marineford and is preparing to leave. When one of the islanders mentions making a show out of the Longarms to get rich, Brook objects and threatens the Longarms to stay away from the island lest they face his retribution. The Longarms agree and are let out of the cage. However, they capture Brook and run off with him, revealing that they do not believe in devils and plan to sell him off to their homeland. The Harahettania Islanders go to perform another summoning ritual while Brook thinks of Luffy, calling out for his help.

In East Blue, we find  Robin making her way across the huge bridge via carriage thanks to the Revolutionaries who freed her from  slavery. They explain that they have been searching for her for ten years since the destruction of  Ohara and are under orders from Dragon to protect her. While appreciative of the offer, Robin declines, mentioning she has her own crew and wishes to get back to them. Not long after she leaves, the Revolutionaries who stayed behind get the newspaper and find out what went on with Luffy. They send one of the carrier crows to deliver it to Robin. The lead revolutionary explains about the bridge and how it was ordered by the Celestial Dragons to be made, and that it has cost many slaves their lives during construction. The paper soon reaches the carriage and is handed off to Robin, who learns of Luffy's current status as well as something else about him.

On Peach Island of the  Kamabakka Kingdom,  Sanji (having somehow snapped out of  Okama trance) is trying to convince the recently returned Ivankov that he is part of Luffy's crew, having read Iva helped him during the Marineford War. Iva does not believe him due to his bounty poster and Sanji constantly saying the name is his, but the picture is not. Getting nowhere, Sanji tries to fight Ivankov so he can steal a boat, but is quickly beaten down. Iva eventually decides to let him know Luffy's current status via the recent newspaper, to which he reacts with shock.  Inazuma tells Iva he has a call from Baltigo, where Dragon and his men are currently residing. Iva worries about his whole identity being public knowledge, but Dragon assures him that it just put his followers at ease knowing that he is human. Dragon comments that soon it'll be time to gather their leaders since the death of Whitebeard is changing the world and the government. Iva however is curious on what happened to their former member, Kuma.

#### The Shocking News: The Rings Heard Around the World[]

Back in the Sabaody Archipelago,  Duval and the  Rosy Life Riders are working diligently to protect the  Thousand Sunny from being taken by hunters looking to sell it to the Marines. In the meantime,  Camie,  Pappag, and  Hatchan talk about the trip to  Fish-Man Island when the Straw Hats return, though Shakky says it'll take some time but figured Rayleigh had reached Luffy already. One of the Rosy Life Riders suddenly cries out that Kuma is coming their way. Shakky prevents Duval and his men from attacking him by asking Kuma if he is still their ally.

In  Arabasta, the kingdom recently had pirate troubles, though the guards are keeping them at bay.  Cobra,  Vivi, and  Karoo also found out about the news of Luffy after reading an article about him. In an unnamed town in an unnamed section of the Grand Line, we find  Crocodile and  Daz Bonez (Mr. 1) having just read the paper about Luffy. Crocodile decides to head back to the New World and asks Mr. 1 if he will join him, which he does. Finally, on another unnamed island in the Grand Line,  Buggy has been reunited with  his crew, having brought all the Impel Down prisoners with him. Buggy is touched that his crewmates were worried about him (though  Alvida points out that they left him to die).  Cabaji and  Mohji introduce themselves to the new crewmates while Buggy shows Alvida  Captain John's map. As he gloats, a bat suddenly arrives with a letter from the government addressed to Buggy.  Mr. 3 reads it and tells Buggy he will not believe what it says.

Meanwhile, the  Five Elders discussed among one another Luffy's current actions, the vacant Warlord positions left vacant by Jinbe, Moria, and Blackbeard, the growing menace of Blackbeard himself and his ambition to become the new Emperor, and the meaning of the  "D". In another section of  Mary Geoise, Sengoku is visiting  Kong and resigning from his position. We also find that Garp has done the same, though Kong states that their records will remain untouched in the hopes of rearing up young marines. Sengoku agrees, reasoning that he is too old for the new era that's coming. He also recommends that  Aokiji succeed him as  Fleet Admiral.

In Marineford, the  Marine Headquarters is slowly being rebuilt little by little since the war.  Smoker meets with Aokiji and states his wish to be transferred to  G-5, a Marine base in the New World. Aokiji warns him that the base is full of problems. But Smoker does not mind, making it obvious he hopes to run into Luffy once again. In the medical base of the island, a doctor checks on  Koby and tells him he has gained Haki due to the shock of the war.  Helmeppo is a little miffed that Koby managed to gain a level of strength, but Koby tells him he does not know what is going on.

In the Agenda Chamber,  Lieutenant Commander Brannew briefs the other officers on what has happened recently, and we finally find out what Luffy did that caused such a stir. He, Jinbe, and Rayleigh went back to Marineford and managed to steal a ship since the security of the island had been stretched thin since Whitebeard's death. They sailed a ring around the island, which was stated to be a ritual for a burial at sea. Luffy then made his way into the plaza to the  Ox Bell at the western edge of the island and rang it 16 times. He then threw a bouquet of flowers over the war wounds that remained on the ground and performed a silent prayer. This act was sent by photographers and journalists, which made it into the papers. Brannew then states that while this may seem like an act of respect to those that have fallen during the war, they should take the 16 bell rings as a declaration of war against the marines.

#### A World in Chaos: The Supernovas Begin to Move[]

In the New World, Eustass Kid has just read about these events and questions  Killer about what the 16 rings mean. Killer responds by explaining that the bell is sacred and that ringing it 16 times may represent the end of one era and the beginning of another. Kid takes this as meaning Luffy wishes to create his own era and sees it as a challenge against him. He then confronts some pirates he captured, the captain of which states he wishes to return to " Paradise" alive. Kid, however, responds by crucifying them, saying that pirates with no resolve should not come out onto that ocean.

Meanwhile,  Capone Bege and  his crew find their  ship suddenly lifted from the ocean into the air by some mysterious force coming from the sky. Luffy is returning from Marineford and is on the  Kuja ship and currently resting (while also being poked and prodded by the  Kuja again along with Rayleigh and Jinbe). Luffy hopes the message will reach his crew. Rayleigh responds that it should if they understand its meaning. The rest of the Straw Hats seem to get it (except for Zoro, who has trouble understanding it).

We then go to the island where Brownbeard took over, and he finds himself meeting  Basil Hawkins. After learning his name and reading his fortune, Hawkins proclaims he does not like jokes (finding Brownbeard's name as such) and, while unsheathing his sword, that the shadow of death on the pirate was visible as he activated his  ability.

We then go to  Urouge, whose  ship comes across an island with lighting coming from it. As he and his  crew marvel at the sight, another ship approaches them with an elderly figure asking if they would like some umbrellas. A caption then comes up telling us that all pirates who entered the New World proclaimed that the first half of the Grand Line was Paradise.

Somewhere near the Sabaody Archipelago, Law is discussing with his crew why he does not want to enter the New World yet, saying that in any case, One Piece will not disappear and that the others are free to engage each other without him. He then tells his men to follow the orders he gave them, in order for him to "steal the proper throne", to which his crew happily rejoices.

On an unnamed winter island in the New World,  X Drake and his  crew confront "Iron Boy"  Scotch, who is guarding the island, which, according to him, is one of Kaidou's favorites, and attacking him will attract the attention of the powerful pirate. Eager for a chance to confront the Emperor, Drake turns into his  dinosaur form and gets ready to fight.

Somewhere else in the New World, on a Spring Island,  Apoo and his crew are fleeing from some big, striped boars. They remain quite surprised when, trying to jump off a cliff, they continue running up into the air with the boars still chasing them.

On a burning island in the New World, the  Blackbeard Pirates are drinking, eating, and relaxing on their raft, which, according to Teach, is breaking apart, so they are waiting to meet the Marines for a battleship in exchange for  Jewelry Bonney, who has been taken hostage by them. Teach approaches her, teasing her and telling her that he will set her free if she becomes his woman, to which Bonney kicks him with her free legs.  Van Augur informs his captain that the Marines do not seem willing to do the exchange, as  Akainu is leading them. The Blackbeard Pirates flee in a hurry, leaving behind their chained prisoner. He tells her that he was concerned when she escaped the World Government, but that the problem has now been resolved. Bonney angrily cries out that she will never forgive them.

In the meantime, in Mary Geoise, Doflamingo is teasing some unknown representative of the World Government, telling him that Moria, while on the verge of death, disappeared suddenly, to which the other replies that that's not a funny story. Doflamingo retorts that as a pirate, he can leave the Seven Warlords of the Sea whenever he wants.

#### Straw Hats Begin to Train: We'll Meet Again in Two Years[]

Back with Chopper, he decided to head back to Torino Kingdom. At first, he was disguised as someone named Chopper Mask, due to his being embarrassed at coming back so soon after he left, though the villagers assured him it was alright. After the disguise fails, he asks to stay and study the plants. As he goes to the library, he realizes the natives on the island are much more advanced than he thought. He hopes to use the knowledge he gains from them to help his captain and crewmates get stronger.

Meanwhile, at the Kamabakka Kingdom, Sanji and Iva are having lunch, to which Sanji finds their food very delicious and inquiries about it. Iva tells him it is the " Attack Cuisine" food that strengthens the body. Sanji sees the benefits of using such a meal for his crew (mostly thinking about what it could do to Nami and Robin) and asks for the recipes. Iva refuses, however, mentioning that it is part of the secret bridal training, and it cannot just be passed on to a random stranger, though if he were an Okama, he would be willing. Sanji refuses this, stating that he was born to love women, not make friends with them. This resolve impresses Iva and tells Sanji that the recipes are being held by 99 masters of  Newkama Kenpo, and if he defeats them, Sanji can take the recipes, though he warns that they, as well as the other Okamas, will try to get him in a dress again. If Sanji endures and wins, Iva will grant his every request. If not, Iva wonders if he will remain a man. Sanji, remembering his first meeting with Luffy, swears that he will give him the best support as the cook of the crew before accepting Iva's challenge.

On the small  sky island of Weatheria, Nami has returned to the Sky Scientists to apologize, in which she was declined, but due to the fact that she promised to jump over to the  blue ocean, she makes them apologize for making her cry. She accepts and demands to have a house and do research about the weather. While researching, Haredas explains that the sky island moves to the will of the wind, that they are researching weather and that the center of weather phenomena is at the Grand Line. She promises not to be an ordinary  navigator because the lives of her crew members depend on her. Nami also asks about a weather phenomenon called "Rain of Lightning" that is a phenomenon that occurs in the New World and insists on Haredas teaching her all about the  Weather Balls and asks if they could be turned into a weapon. Haredas responds that she should never say such dangerous things.

Meanwhile, in the Teena Geena Kingdom, on  Kenzan Island in the Grand Line, Brook is imprisoned in a cage and is displayed to the public as a freak show. Due to the message that he read in the news, Brook has stayed still for a while, making the audience mad and causing them to think that he is just a prop. After thinking about what he could do to become better, he performs a 40-degree trick and falls down, stating that if he goes lower than his usual 45-degree trick, he will slip and fall. The movement causes the audience to believe he is real and cheer. Brook comes up with a new solo, "BONE to be Wild" and starts performing it with a guitar, stating that the word "ALONE" is no longer in his dictionary.

In East Blue, under  Tequila Wolf's bridge, Nico Robin accepts the Revolutionaries' offer to meet Dragon at Baltigo. She teases the revolutionaries, stating that if she had known they had such groups, she would have had them come earlier. When she rides the ship that the Revolutionaries use to go to Baltigo, she refuses to go inside and stays on the ship's balcony, even in the harsh weather, for she states that she does not like the idea of being invited into a room with no escape, to which the Revolutionaries respond that their intentions bear no malice. Since she does not accept the invitation to go inside, the Revolutionaries prepare her warm food and drinks, blankets, windshields, and a sofa on the balcony of the ship. Robin thinks that going to her captain's father could make her stronger and states that this is the first time she wanted to become stronger for someone else.

Meanwhile, in Karakuri, the marines led by  Captain Gorilla investigate the "Nightmare of Baldimore" incident and have information that Cyborg Franky might be behind it, but question how he could arrive on the island while there is no report of the arrival of an icebreaker ship. Meanwhile, in the kingdom's mountains, Franky locates another laboratory whose entrance was exposed after the explosion. Inside, he finds blueprints, but instead of cultural creations, these blueprints are about weapons, ranging from battleships to human cells. Franky decides to live there and become stronger, leaving the mountain once in a while to get some  cola from his companions' house. Due to his wrecked face scaring his friends, Franky decides to wear a tiger fur rug, but after lighting a fireplace, Franky's tiger fur gets caught on fire, causing him to run wild and scaring the marines investigating the area, making them think he is a beast. That incident was later called the " Legend of the Sacred Burning Beast of Baldimore," which is passed through generations in the Grand Line.

Still in the Grand Line, Boin Archipelago, Usopp decides to lose weight, gain muscles, and become stronger, causing Heracles to wonder what is in the newspaper to turn Usopp's determination around. Usopp said that he got a message from his captain and that he needed to become stronger. He asks about Heracles' weapon and asks him to teach him, and tells him that he is an amazing teacher, which flatters Heracles. He teaches Usopp everything he knows, including the " Pop Green", which are the seeds of hostile plants that grow in the forest with various uses. Usopp then promises to become the true king of snipers.

Back in the Shikkearu Kingdom, Zoro goes back to Mihawk's castle and bows, begging Mihawk to train him. Mihawk dismisses Zoro's plea, thinking he is coming back after being defeated. Zoro reveals he defeated all the humandrills but admits that at his level, he will not be able to surpass Mihawk. Mihawk realizes he is not doing it for himself, and soon agrees to train Zoro once his body is healed. While Perona is fixing up his wounds, Zoro reveals the message Luffy sent to his crew. A tattoo on his arm that said "2Y." Zoro explains that the 3D meant they were supposed to meet at Sabaody in 3 days, but since it was crossed out and replaced with 2Y, that means the time to meet again is now two years. Luffy had purposefully drawn attention to himself to get the message out to the crew, knowing that they would need to strengthen themselves if they wished to take on the New World.

The story then goes back to Amazon Lily, a few days earlier. Jinbe has decided to head back to Fish-Man Island, thanking Luffy for freeing him and mentioning that he would wait for him to visit Fish-Man Island in two years. With that, he heads off, and Luffy and the Kuja bid him farewell. Afterward, Luffy, the Kuja Pirates, and Rayleigh head to an abandoned island not far from Amazon Lily called  Rusukaina. Rayleigh brought Luffy there to train him. He forbids Hancock and her pirates from coming to see Luffy during his training period, so he can make him stronger without distraction. Once the Kuja Pirates are gone, Rayleigh begins Luffy's training by mentioning that the island was once inhabited, but the chaotic climate changes and the ferocious nature of the wildlife eventually killed all the natives. As a wild elephant comes charging at them, Rayleigh explains the basic concepts of Haki, using the elephant to demonstrate them.

Luffy realizes that he has seen these techniques before in some form or another during his adventures. Rayleigh hopes to use those two years to teach him the basics of controlling the different types of Haki, as it would take longer with a normal person. After a night of rest, Luffy goes off to begin his training, setting his straw hat and  Vivre Card on a rock in the only safe place on the island.
