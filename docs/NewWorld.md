## Fish-Man Island Saga

### __Return to Sabaody Arc__

#### Two Years Later[]

Two years have passed, and  Luffy retrieves his  straw hat just as  Hancock and the  Kuja Pirates arrive to take him back to the  Sabaody Archipelago. Luffy displays his increased strength when he shows that he has made friends with the wildlife and warns the animals not to hurt his friends. Hancock is even more infatuated with Luffy, though he tells her that he is not marrying her. With that, he places his hat on his head and prepares to leave  Rusukaina.

Meanwhile, the Sabaody Archipelago has become much more lawless due to  Marineford having switched locations to an area in the  New World and their old base now being a common  Marine base called  G-1 that used to be on the other side of the  Red Line. Rumors of the  Straw Hats suddenly reappearing and recruiting new members have circulated.  Brook is now a superstar, touring the  Grand Line as the "Soul King." The  Longarm Tribe that captured him are now his managers. Sabaody is the final stop on Brook's tour, as well as his farewell concert to his fans.

Next,  Sanji arrives with some of the  okama. Right after he sets foot on the island, he is overjoyed to see real women again. He gives the okama a quick goodbye (while also flipping them off), thanking them for bringing him to Sabaody and telling them to give  Iva his best before he runs off to try to find  Nami and  Robin. Meanwhile, in a bar, a woman is talking with the bartender about what has happened with Marineford. The talk is interrupted when a shot rings out, coming from a bunch of pirates who claim to be the "Straw Hat Pirates." Those pirates, however, do not resemble the actual Straw Hat Pirates at all. The commotion from before was "Luffy" along with "Nami", "Franky" and "Sogeking." They have shot a captain who was trying to join them when they found out he was only worth 55,000,000, commenting that they wanted pirates with a bounty of at least 70,000,000. They have managed to recruit three pirate groups with 10 men that have  bounties. Among them are "Wet-Hair"  Caribou and "Blood-Splatterer"  Coribou who have 210,000,000 and 190,000,000 on their heads.

As "Luffy" calls for more drinks, he notices the woman from before and invites her over. She politely refuses, which quickly gains the ire of the "Straw Hats." It is actually the real Nami, who is then warned by the bartender to choose her words carefully, pointing out that it was a very bad idea to provoke the "Straw Hats." Nami ignores them and proceeds to enjoy her drink. The  Fake Nami tries to threaten her but a carnivorous plant suddenly appears from out of nowhere and chomps on her and the  Fake Luffy, as well as the other fake Straw Hats. Nami finds that the culprit for this deed is none other than  Usopp, whom she instantly hugs upon seeing. Nami and Usopp leave the bar as the  Fake Straw Hats try to go after them, but are stopped when black bubbles suddenly appear, forming into a cloud, and shock them. Fake Luffy recovers and orders his group to search for and kill the two.

Meanwhile, over at Grove 13 and Shakky's Bar, Sanji has arrived and found out that  Zoro arrived on the island first.  Franky arrived ten days later and made his way to the  Thousand Sunny, which had been guarded by  Duval and his men, for which Sanji expressed gratitude. Sanji also learns that Nami, Usopp,  Chopper, and Brook have arrived as well. This leaves Luffy and Robin as the only two unaccounted for.  Rayleigh, who is also present in the bar, states that he only trained Luffy for a year and a half before leaving him and has not seen him since.

In another part of the island, Robin, who has recently arrived, discovers that she is being followed by unknown men and is perplexed by Brook's concert and the Straw Hats' recruitment of new members.

In Grove 47, Chopper is following who he thinks is Zoro and Sanji, but in reality, is more of the Fake Straw Hats; this group is comprised of the former two as well as a Robin and Chopper, who are a short woman and fox, respectively.  Fake Zoro and  Fake Sanji recognize Chopper as a real Straw Hat. Thinking he is abandoned by his crew and believing he is their "pet," they plan to lure him over to their side to make the Fake Straw Hats look more credible.  Fake Robin tries to entice Chopper with a cucumber, but the men who were following Robin rush in and grab the fake one, along with the  Fake Chopper, in a sack before fleeing.

#### Luffy vs. Fake Luffy[]

Meanwhile in G-1, the rumors of the Straw Hats reach the Marines.  Vice Admiral  Momonga quickly deploys his troops to the island. Back on Sabaody, Fake Luffy has shot an innocent bystander thinking it was Nami and Usopp. When her friend protests, he is shot as well. Fake Luffy orders his crew to find the real Nami and Usopp, but is suddenly knocked down by the figure from before. The said figure apologizes to him and starts to head off, but when Fake Luffy calls out to him, the figure turns around to answer him, which is actually the real Luffy in disguise.

In a flashback, Luffy says his goodbyes to the Kuja Pirates. Hancock suggests that Luffy wear a hood to conceal his identity, as she knows the Marines are still looking for him even after two years. She also gives him an overpacked sack of clothes and goodies, much to  Nyon's annoyance. Luffy then bids farewell to Hancock and the Kujas, promising they'll meet again (though Hancock takes it as another proposal). Back in the present day, Fake Luffy is threatening Luffy with his pistol and trying to get Luffy to fear him. The rest of Fake Luffy's crew join in to intimidate Luffy, with the crowd hoping he will go along with their wishes. However, Luffy simply brushes them off and turns to leave. Fake Luffy goes to shoot him, but Luffy manages to dodge the bullet at point blank range and then uses  Haoshoku Haki on the Fake Straw Hats causing them to faint, which astonishes the crowd.

Meanwhile, Robin arrives at the Thousand Sunny, and finds Franky, who has transformed into a much more robotic figure. She comes aboard and finds that the ship has been  coated and is ready for underwater travel. She also finds out that the rest of the Straw Hats have arrived on the island, except for Luffy. When Robin asks about Brook's concert, Franky answers that he's been touring, and has risen to become a superstar since they first found him in the  Florian Triangle and even doubts Brook will rejoin the crew.

In Grove 47, Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji, along with the real Chopper, have regrouped with the Fake Straw Hats, who are recovering. They report Fake Robin's (whose real name is Cocoa) kidnapping to the Fake Luffy, with Chopper frantically trying to get the group to go after them. Fake Luffy, however, dismisses his crewmate's kidnapping. He orders the bunch to gather up their recruited pirates to track down the real Luffy, Nami, and Usopp, starting from Grove 46. Chopper runs off, unable to believe they would just abandon "Robin," and goes off to try to rescue her himself. Unbeknownst to him and the Fake Straw Hats, some Marines have been monitoring them.

They report this to Grove 66, another Marine base, which causes the Marines to mobilize. They are ordered to direct the civilians away from the Grove which will soon become a battlefield as reinforcements from G-1 would later arrive. Among them is  Sentomaru, who decides to bring along two  Pacifistas. He warns his troops not to underestimate the crew as they may have gotten stronger in the last two years, especially their captain, Luffy, whom he declares to be an entirely different caliber than the usual over 100,000,000 bounty rookies that gather at the Archipelago.

Meanwhile, in Grove 42, Sanji comes across a fisherman and tries to buy some fish, but the man is panicking because he had a client who wanted to go fishing. The fisherman told him to get on the boat, but instead the man got on a pirate ship by mistake, which took off underwater. When Sanji hears the description of the man, he realizes who it is and tells the fisherman not to panic as the man can take care of himself.

However, as he says that, a pirate ship suddenly floats back up from underwater, now cut in half. The captain of the ship yells at an individual on the mast, bemoaning how he ruined their dream to get to the New World. The said figure is not fazed and just tells him it was their bad luck to meet him. It is then revealed that the person on the mast is none other than Zoro, who grumbles about getting on the wrong ship.

Chopper gallops through Sabaody Archipelago's Grove 35 in his reindeer form, yelling wildly for Robin (the fake one that was kidnapped) while also questioning the actions of the Straw Hats (the fake ones). He abruptly stops as Usopp and Nami ride by on one of the Archipelago's bubble contraptions, calling to him. Finally reunited on the island, they embrace as long-seen old friends. Both Usopp and Nami comment on how big and fluffy Chopper has become as he tries to separate the fake Nami from the real one before him in his mind. Catching himself, Chopper informs them of Robin's kidnapping. Revelations abound as all three ride the bubble, and Chopper is brought up to speed on what's going on. He realizes that the kidnapped Robin is a fake (as the real one would not be easy to catch) and that the Straw Hats he met before were also fakes. Chopper, though, swoons at the idea of how famous he is, motivating him to want to create a signature. Usopp comments that he's already created his own, while Nami adds that they are famous in a bad way.

Meanwhile, Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji chase after the real Chopper, after their Captain makes the realization that it was the real "pet," but run into Luffy (also the real one), whose identity they are still ignorant of. Upon his last run-in and Hancock's suggestion, he finally dons the fake mustache given to him and mistakes the fakes for the real ones, though they question whether he is the "kid" they are looking for.

In Grove 41, the real Zoro states his intention to fish at the beach. The real Sanji responds by yelling at him, explaining they do not have time to search for a "wayward marimo" (should Zoro's incredible talent for getting lost remain intact), and that they, together, should head to the ship as everyone will gather there soon. Turning away from Sanji, Zoro complains to himself that #7 thinks he's so high and mighty over #1, with the numbers being a reference to the order the Straw Hats arrived on the archipelago. Sanji, now beyond annoyed by Zoro, starts a fight.

In Grove 46, a Marine is spying on the new rookies trying to join the "Straw Hats." He confirms four of them: Gashed  Albion at a bounty of 92,000,000, Lip Service  Doughty at a bounty of 88,000,000 and the brothers Caribou, Wet-Hair, and Blood-Splatterer at bounties of 210,000,000 and 190,000,000, respectively. As the Marine is speaking on the  Den Den Mushi, he further adds how unthinkable it would be for the future if this company of people were to be united as one crew with "Straw Hat Luffy" as their Captain, when Wet-Hair Caribou suddenly looms over from behind the fractured wall that the Marine was leaning against. The Marine falls back on the ground in horror as the Caribou Brothers intimidate him, prompting his superiors to bring him back up upon realizing that their mole had been spotted at the other end of the Den Den Mushi line. Frightened, the Marine reaches for his gun, causing Wet-Hair to stab him with a spear. To add to the gravity of their actions, Blood-Splatterer begins digging a grave while his older brother preaches to God about the "sins" this Marine has committed. Tensions rise as a confrontational statement is heard: "That's as far as you go, Caribou!"

Voices roar as Fake Luffy boosts the spirits of his followers, who all believe that following him will lead their pirating careers to greater heights, having achieved such notoriety in the past for inflicting massive damage on the  World Government's three prominent facilities ( Enies Lobby,  Impel Down, and Marineford). Some of them even root for him as a worthy candidate for the next Pirate King, and being part of his crew meant some shared glory in the future. He appropriates them as extensions of himself, his "hands" and "legs." His orders are to find and crush the real Straw Hats that humiliated him. During his rant, Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji return with the real Luffy. Luffy speaks to the fakes, assuming them to be the real ones, yet noticing that they are more friendly than he remembers. The fakes call for their captain's attention, and the target, Luffy, stands before his eyes.

"Encore! Encore!" the crowd yells at Brook's farewell concert. Unfortunately, the Marines and his former managers have flanked him. The Marines confirm him as "Humming Brook," with a 33,000,000 bounty, and a member of the Straw Hat crew. Brook's fans are distressed by the news, while others silently ponder whether Brook should be granted leniency, even if he truly was a member of the Straw Hats, which were long thought to be dead and gone. His managers explained that, by telling them honestly that Brook would be retiring, it would be the end of the business exploit, hence inciting them to have Brook die with them. In fact, this incites Brook to call on his band and dancers to help him declare that the rumors were false. "Straw Hat Luffy... Dead? Ridiculous! Tell This to the World. The Pirate Straw Hat Luffy is ALIVE!" The Marines are held by the fans as Brook rocks the concert, ready to go to the New World.

Back on the newly coated Thousand Sunny, newly refurbished, Nami, Usopp, and Chopper meet up with the rest of the crew. Usopp holds Chopper as he gawks at the new upgrades on Franky, who now sports concealable hands within his giant ones and a hair-frizz feature. Nami is overjoyed to see the real Robin again and, to a lesser extent, the real Franky. Rayleigh and  Shakky show up. Shakky updates the current crew on deck, where the others are, and the situations on the archipelago. Rayleigh approaches Nami, intent on teaching her how to navigate a coated ship. Usopp, worried since Luffy has not shown up, asks about him. Rayleigh responds with a smile that Luffy has already arrived.

#### Reunited at Last! Show the Training Results![]

Meanwhile, in Grove 33, one of the Marines reports that they are unable to capture Brook as the crowd has held them back and the musician has run off during the chaos. We soon find that he was with the  Flying Fish Riders, who comment that Shakky told them to pick him up. Brook is more than grateful and excited to reunite with the Straw Hats.

In Grove 41, Franky contacts Sanji with Zoro, telling him where to meet up. When Zoro asks what's going on, Sanji slowly spells it out for him, causing a brief argument. However, it's interrupted when they notice some noise coming from a nearby island. In Grove 46, Fake Luffy is about to sic his pirates on the real Luffy, commenting that it'll serve as a warning to whomever crosses him, while Luffy asks Fake Zoro and Fake Sanji if he (Fake Luffy) is a friend of theirs. Before anything can happen, the Marines arrive and surround the pirates, ordering Fake Luffy's surrender. Fake Luffy orders Caribou and Coribou to use the Marine they wounded earlier as a shield to make an exit. Caribou, however, comments that it's too tall an order and kills the Marine right then and there, claiming it was punishment for lying about not calling the Marines.

With their bargaining chip gone, the Marines rush the pirates, who attack in kind. The real Luffy wonders what the heck is going on as his fake self quickly loses control of the situation. If that is not bad enough, the Pacifistas arrive and begin shooting at the pirates. Doughty is caught in the blast and knocked out, shocking the pirates how an 88,000,000 bounty did not stand a chance. They soon start calling for "Luffy" to help them. But the Fake Straw Hats and he are fleeing the scene, knowing they do not stand a chance. It does them little good as they are confronted by Sentomaru and a Pacifista. The pirates believe that Fake Luffy will easily defeat them. Fake Luffy nervously tries to threaten the Marine captain but is quickly hammered into the ground and taken out, much to his crew's surprise.

Sentomaru realizes that Fake Luffy has tricked the pirates present and orders the Pacifista to identify him. It does, revealing he is a lowly-26,000,000 Bounty pirate named "Three-Tongued" Demaro Black. Their ruse exposed, the rest of the Fake Straw Hats make a run for it while their now-former subordinates are outraged at being deceived. The real Luffy quickly figures out what's going on too, though he comments that "Zoro" and "Sanji" looked like the real deal. Sentomaru orders the arrest of every pirate there, commenting that he knows the real Luffy is in the crowd and has his Pacifista aimed for him.

Luffy manages to jump away as the other pirates are caught in the blast. However, his disguise is knocked off, revealing himself to everyone in the area. The Fakes foam at the mouth when they realize they had actually threatened the real deal. The Marine quickly runs, while Sentomaru confronts Luffy, ordering his Pacifista to fire another shot.

Luffy, however, dodges the blast and goes into , then takes to the air and hits the Pacifista as it tries to fire again, knocking it out in one hit. Everyone is shocked by the feat, especially Sentomaru, as he noticed that Luffy had  Haki equipped. As Luffy leaves the area, he sees the real Zoro and Sanji running towards him. However, another Pacifista gets in their way and prepares to fire. But both instantly hit it with their attacks, cutting and breaking Pacifista's neck in the process. The pirates soon realize that these Straw Hats are indeed the real deal.

As Zoro and Sanji prepare to exit the area, they notice Luffy has not moved yet. Luffy yells out to Rayleigh, who is on a far-off hill observing the area and making sure Luffy is alright. Luffy thanks him for everything over the last two years and yells that he is going to be the Pirate King. The pirates are left speechless while Sanji, Zoro, and Rayleigh just smile, the latter with tears in his eyes.

The Marines closing in snap Luffy back to attention, and he continues to run, thanking Rayleigh one more time. Rayleigh, remembering their training together, tells Luffy to go straight for the top. He then gets in the Marines' way and draws a line in the ground, warning them not to cross it. Meanwhile, Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro continue to flee but find themselves surrounded by more Marines. However,  negative ghosts suddenly appear and stop them, revealing  Perona to the trio. She chides Zoro when he asks why she is still there, revealing that she was the one who brought him to Sabaody. She then warns the three that Marine ships are near the island.

Back in Grove 42, Brook has reunited with the other Straw Hats on the Thousand Sunny, immediately asking to see Nami's panties once on board (and once more getting kicked for his trouble). Chopper returns, having gone on to get Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji using the  Sayin Goabird from the  Torino Kingdom. The group is more than overjoyed to see their captain after so long. Sanji is especially happy to see Nami and Robin, so much so that he gets a gushing nosebleed, which Usopp ordered Chopper to fix. Luffy then starts to marvel at Franky's new body, but Nami tells him it is not the time. Marine ships suddenly arrive and start firing cannonballs at Sunny. But they are suddenly stopped by . Hancock's ship gets in front of the Marines, forcing them to stop firing. Hancock demands to know why there is a Marine ship in their path and winks at Luffy, obviously creating a diversion for him. The others are surprised that a  Warlord of the Sea is helping them. Luffy explains that she is a friend of his, earning Sanji's jealousy.

Franky opens the valves under the ship, letting air into the coating jelly and expanding it, turning it into a giant dome that covers Sunny's deck. As it does, Usopp notices that no Marines from the mainland are chasing them anymore. It is soon explained why, as the Straw Hats' allies from during their separation are keeping the Marines at bay.  Heracles uses giant horned beetles against them, wishing Usopp luck on his journey.  Haredas and his fellow weather scientists manufacture rain over the island, soaking the Marines' gunpowder. Perona uses more of her  on the Marines. The okamas are dealing with another bunch of Marines, trying to break their hearts.

As all this goes on, Nami explains how the coating works, Telling the crew that it works against water pressure but that the ship will no longer be buoyant. Once the floating bag is removed, the ship will sink. Franky then removes the bag, and Nami orders everyone to raise the sail, which confuses Usopp. Robin explains that the underwater currents work similarly to wind on a coated ship. Once Luffy is told they are ready to leave, he thanks the crew for putting up with his "selfish wish" for the last two years. With that, the Thousand Sunny dives underwater. The crew on the Marine ship frantically tries to get their captain to go after them, but he is too smitten by Hancock to notice.

Luffy then gives the order to set sail, and the Straw Hats, reunited after two years, continue their journey to the New World. Their next stop:  Fish-Man Island!

### __Fish-Man Island Arc__

#### Last Thoughts from Sabaody: The Straw Hats Descend[]

After the  Straw Hats escape, in a place in the  Sabaody Archipelago known as "No Man's Land,"  Coribou and  Caribou, along with  their crew, have captured the remaining  Fake Straw Hat Crew and are digging their graves. The fakes beg the brothers to let them go, but they refuse, revealing that they had planned to kill the real Straw Hats from the inside after joining them and were not amused when they found out they had been lied to. When  Drip, the fake Sanji, continues to beg, Caribou reveals he has  Devil Fruit powers,  turning his arm into a gooey substance and smothering him.  Fake Sogeking tries to shoot him, but the cannonball ends up being absorbed into his body, revealing that he is a  Logia user. Caribou orders his men to bury the imposters alive. He then excitedly announces that he managed to confirm the real Straw Hats' location.

Back in Grove 46,  Sentomaru reports back to his base, mentioning he managed to capture  Demaro Black and most of Demaro's recruited pirates except for the Caribou Pirates and the other Straw Hat Imposters (sans  Cocoa and  Fake Chopper), who somehow disappeared from the plaza. He also comments on the Straw Hats' newfound strength after easily destroying the two  Pacifistas he brought along with him and tells his base to call  Marine Headquarters in the  New World and warn them that the Straw Hats have finally revived.

The scene then moves to a shore where  Rayleigh is watching the ocean.  Shakky joins him and comments on how quickly the Straw Hats left. She then asks if Rayleigh is recalling something. He jokingly comments "maybe" and then remembers when he first met  Roger, who surprisingly looked very much like  Luffy when he was younger, even wearing the same  straw hat. Rayleigh then comments to Shakky that destiny is slowly taking shape and that Luffy has proven himself worthy of wearing that certain Straw Hat. He also mentions that it would not be a bad idea to live a bit longer.

Meanwhile, underwater, the Straw Hats take in the sights of the undersea world, including the roots beneath Sabaody and the massive fish swimming around them.  Robin then notices that the ship's bubble shares the same characteristics as those on Sabaody.  Nami confirms it, mentioning that anything strong enough to pass through the bubble will just go right through it, allowing them to fire the ship's weapons if necessary. When  Usopp asks what could break it, Nami answers that poking multiple holes in the bubble will indeed pop it, so they have to be careful not to let a  Sea King bite into it or smash into a reef.

Luffy remembers that  Hancock had fixed him food, so he shares his bentos with the crew while Usopp wonders why  Hatchan is not guiding them like he promised two years ago.  Franky says he needs to tell the crew something. In the two years they were gone, both Hatchan and  Duval protected the  Thousand Sunny the best way they could, but both were heavily wounded, and Hatchan had to retire and head back to  Fish-Man Island. A year after he left, the  Marines found out about the Sunny and came to try and capture it. However, there was one more warrior who protected the ship:  Bartholomew Kuma.

Franky explains that after he arrived back on Sabaody, he found Kuma heavily damaged and rusted. Kuma then declared his mission complete and headed off, which confuses Franky. Franky then found out from Rayleigh that, during their battle against  Kizaru, Kuma had whispered to Rayleigh that he was a  Revolutionary and wished to help the Straw Hats escape. After blasting the Straw Hats away, he later met with Rayleigh and told him he did not have much time left. Since he was treated like a guinea pig by the Marines, his body was becoming more machine than human. He then made a deal with  Dr. Vegapunk that before his personality was completely gone, he would have a program embedded in him to return to the Straw Hats' ship and guard it until one of the Straw Hats returned.

The Straw Hats are astonished that Kuma would go to such great lengths to protect them, figuring that Kuma did it as a favor to  Dragon. Franky then warns them that while they are indebted to Kuma for saving them, the next time they meet he will have likely become a heartless human weapon. They are unaware that the Caribou Pirates are right behind them, and Caribou is still obsessed with destroying them.

#### The Route to Fish-Man Island: Encountering a Legendary Ghost Ship[]

The ship descends into the Euphotic Zone and is about to exit another level called the Disphotic Zone, about 1,000 meters below the surface. While they are sailing, the Caribou Pirates ship, towed by a monster, is rapidly approaching Thousand Sunny from behind. Caribou is rallying the crew, getting them ready for their upcoming attack, and planning to make him famous to the world by taking the Straw Hats' heads.

Back on the Sunny, Usopp sees something gaining on them, thinking it is a sea monster, and tells the crew there is a shadow heading directly toward them.  Caribou's ship soon catches up and comes alongside the Sunny. The Straw Hats wonder whose ship it is. Caribou leads the assault. At that moment, Nami recognizes the monster pulling the ship as  Momoo, the pet sea cow of the  Arlong Pirates. Momoo sees Nami,  Sanji, and Luffy and remembers all three of them from the past. He recalls the beatings he received from Luffy and Sanji and swims back the opposite way out of terror, towing the ship with him, but not before Caribou, and only Caribou, was able to make it onto the Thousand Sunny's deck. Caribou, unaware he was left behind, commands his crew to introduce themselves by slaughtering all the Straw Hats. He immediately realizes that he is the only one of his crew on board the ship and immediately changes his tune.

Franky picks him up with one hand, with Caribou begging him not to throw him out into the ocean. Franky, instead, simply throws him against one of the side rails of the ship. Caribou immediately denies he was the captain of the crew, saying he is just a human bullet for that crew and that he is sick of being on that ship. He then asks the Straw Hats if it would be alright if he rode with them for a while. The Straw Hats allow it but keep him bound with a rope. The scene momentarily switches back to the Caribou Pirates ship, with the crew trying to tell Momoo to stop and asking him what happened. Coribou then says that Caribou will save them for sure.

Back on the Sunny, Caribou is reworking his plan. Since he can get out of the ropes any time he pleases and since he cannot fight nine people at once, he thinks it would be best to observe the crew and wait for a chance to kill them one by one. Luffy asks if it would not be faster to travel in a straight line, but Nami explains that if they continue straight, they would just be swallowed up by currents and could hit a volcano or sea mountain before finishing their descent.

She also explains that there is only one safe route and tells everyone to put on a coat, saying the journey would get a lot colder since the water in the deep sea is cold.  Brook then adds that the colder levels have what are called  Deep Currents. These are large ocean currents that are normally invisible to the naked eye and move in a completely different pattern than surface currents. Brook says that he has heard that the Deep Currents move very slowly across the ocean floor, and that once someone is down that deep, it could take nearly 2,000 years to return to a part of the sea that gets sunlight. Nami says that in order to get there, they need to ride a descending current that takes them from a surface current to a deep current. Franky then calls to her from the bow of the ship, saying "it" has come into view.

Everyone goes to the bow. Luffy asks what the current looks like. Franky, in response to seeing it, marvels at Mother Nature's creation, the great  Downward Plume. Caribou, who had been quiet the whole time, stands up and tells the Straw Hats to turn back immediately, saying that something is wrong.

Luffy says he sees a monster at the bottom. Caribou claims that he has never heard of a sea monster living in a downward plume. The monster in question is a  Kraken, a giant, mythological octopus. Franky adds that it can crush multiple ships in a single blow and that it must have been staying there, feeding on the ships that traveled there in the past few days. Luffy, not intimidated by its massive size and appearance, decides to tame it.

Caribou's ship suddenly returns, with Coribou and the rest of the crew, including Momoo, determined to save Caribou. However, before they can get close, they are grabbed by one of the Kraken's tentacles, which quickly destroys their  coating bubble and their ship. This causes Caribou's crew to seemingly drown, much to his chagrin. The Kraken then sets its sights on the Sunny. Luffy and  Zoro prepare to attack, but Usopp stops them, warning that they will break holes in the coating bubble. Franky activates the ship's  to avoid some of the tentacles. Noticing that Luffy will not change his mind about fighting, Caribou comes up with a suggestion.

Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji are in their personal coating bubble, which Caribou calls "Barefoot Coating," which are essentially man-made diving suits. Caribou tells them they can now go fight without damaging the ship and can find their way back using a rope lifeline. Usopp initially complains about this, but when Caribou explains which would be better, fighting on the ship or away from it, Usopp changes his mind. The "Monster Trio" heads out, leaving their lifelines behind as they feel they will get in their way. The Kraken attacks again, and Franky fires rockets from his shoulders, repelling a tentacle. The Kraken attacks with another one, but  Chopper eats a  Rumble Ball and goes into , protecting the ship. The Sunny is thrown back toward a mountain as a result, but Robin manages to conjure  two large hands and keep it from crashing.

Luffy goes into  and equips a  Busoshoku Haki, hardening his arm. However, as he is using it in the ocean, he is weakening as a result. The Kraken tries to grab him, but Sanji dashes through the water using  toward it outside his bubble. He then hits the Kraken with . Zoro goes in next and uses  Santoryu Ogi: Rokudo no Tsuji to cut off one of the Kraken's tentacles into six pieces. Luffy complains to the two that they are going to take off all its legs before hitting the Kraken with . This beats the Kraken, though the group notices a large shark with a shirt on swimming around the Kraken. Before they can wonder what is going on, though, they are all swept up in the current of the Downward Plume and pulled further down. Franky, with Nami's navigation, manages to keep the ship from crashing, but the Monster Trio ends up separated from the ship.

Those aboard the Sunny find themselves in a very dark and cold part of the ocean, unaware of the sea monsters swimming around. As they activate some lights, they find themselves staring face-to-face with a few of them, much to their horror. A caption comes up, commenting that the area they are in is known as "The Deep Sea," a part of the sea where light cannot reach, and no normal creature exists. It is also known as "The Underworld of the Sea."

The Straw Hats still on board the Sunny are looking for Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji in the dark depths of the Deep Sea. Brook notices that Caribou has escaped from the ropes that were holding him. Caribou hides in a barrel nearby as everyone realizes he could be hiding anywhere on the ship, and they need to be on their guard. He seems pleased that the Monster Trio is gone, saying they all must be dead by now. He is disappointed that he could not take Luffy's head, but figures that the heads of the rest of the crew would be just as good. He thinks to himself that he should wait until they land at Fish-Man Island to attack.

While Caribou is formulating his plan, Franky notices him in the barrel. Franky promptly forces the lid of the barrel down and seals the barrel with ropes and by bolting large metal holding plates along the sides of both ends of the barrel. Franky realizes that Caribou had let himself get hit by Sanji earlier in order to hide his mud-like  Logia powers. Franky concludes that the crew would have been in trouble if Caribou was not such an idiot. Franky then notices that something is bothering Chopper and asks him what is wrong. Chopper says that it has become really hot, and Usopp agrees. The crew then notices that they are heading into a cloud of smoke. Nami realizes that the presence smoke under water, along with hydrothermal mineral deposits, could only indicate that they are in a deep-sea volcanic region. The Sunny is right above the mouths of several volcanoes. Franky claims that if the volcanoes erupted, they would perish instantly, and then steers the ship away from the volcanoes.

Chopper then notices a light in the distance and wonders if they have reached Fish-Man Island. Franky uses his  as a morse code, but the light turns out to belong to a giant angler fish. The fish tries to eat the ship, but is stopped by a giant humanoid creature, which is incorrectly identified as an  Umibozu, a sea giant, by Usopp. The giant punches the angler fish, whose name is  Ankoro, saying that it was not supposed to eat ships and that Captain  Vander Decken would be mad at them. Brook then hears someone singing, and a ghostly ship approaches from behind the giant.

Brook identifies the ship as the legendary  Flying Dutchman. He then proceeded to give the history of the ship and its captain. It is called "the ship that should not be." The story dates back hundreds of years. On a stormy day, a captain became deranged and started throwing his crew overboard, killing all of them. The captain's name was Vander Decken. He incurred the wrath of God and was doomed to an eternity of wandering the sea, forbidden to ever make port. That ship is the very same ship that they see before them—the cursed ship of Vander Decken. He told the angler fish and the giant, whose name is Wadatsumi, that they would not get treasure if they ate the ship.

He then commands Wadatsumi to destroy the Thousand Sunny. The Straw Hats are saved when the Kraken shows up out of nowhere and punches Wadatsumi. Everyone on the ship is surprised to see it again. The Kraken continues to beat up the giant until Luffy orders him to stop, which it does. Everyone is relieved to see that Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji are alive. Luffy did not like it in the cramped bubble, and he sprawls out on the deck of the ship, happy for so much room. As the Thousand Sunny is placed on the Kraken's head, Luffy declares that he will turn the Kraken, whom he has named  Surume, into a top-notch navigator. Usopp says that they should be careful to ensure that the ship is not crushed. Everyone then hears a rumbling sound coming from one of the volcanoes. Vander Decken's crew alerts him that there is trouble as Nami realizes the volcano is about to erupt.

#### Straw Hats at Fish-Man Island: Revelations and a Terrifying Prediction[]

As both parties realize what is going to happen, Vander Decken decides to pull out, ordering Wadatsumi and Ankoro to pull the ship away from the area. Surume takes the Sunny away from there. Both parties get a good distance away before the volcano explodes, sending out a shockwave. The Flying Dutchman, along with Wadatsumi and Ankoro, are blown away, though Surume is able to keep ahead as the magma begins to run down the volcano. Surume jumps in a darker area, falling into the trench as the volcano erupts again, causing an avalanche that destroys the trench above them and sends rocks falling toward the Sunny. A stray boulder falls on Surume, knocking him out, and both he and the Sunny plummet into the abyss.

Luckily, after falling through the trench, the Straw Hats find themselves still in one piece, with the Sunny lying on its side at the bottom of the ocean floor. They notice light emitting from somewhere and find that it's their long-sought destination, Fish-Man Island, an island wrapped in a gigantic bubble.

Before they can go to the island, a voice calls out to Surume, criticizing him for letting humans order him around. Surume becomes scared, lets go of the Sunny, and runs off. And with good reason, as the Sunny is surrounded by a gang of much larger Sea Kings. The voice belongs to a  daggertooth piked conger  fish-man named  Hammond, a crewmember of the  New Fish-Man Pirates. He says that he knows about the Straw Hat Pirates, the ones who crushed  Arlong's ambition but also protected Hatchan and assaulted one of the  World Nobles.

He then gives the crew two choices: join them or be sunk right there and then. The only choice the Straw Hats have is to run and charge straight toward Fish-Man Island with . Hammond once again asks if Luffy will join him, and Luffy, without a care in the world, rejects Hammond just as the preparations for the  are set. Franky activates it, and the ship blasts off to Fish-Man Island. They make it in, but the coating of the Sunny wears off, and they all get separated after the ship falls into a current.

Sometime later, Luffy wakes up and finds himself in  Camie's house with Sanji, Chopper, and Usopp. The strong sea currents took the rest of the Straw Hats somewhere else, and they were lucky to be found by the  mermaids. While at Camie's house, she introduces the Straw Hats to her friends, the  Medaka Mermaid Quintuplets, and tells them that she works at  Mermaid Cafe with her friends. As the group boards a turtle that will take them to the top of the island, Camie explains that Hatchan is in the  Fish-Man District still recovering from his wounds that he got while protecting the Thousand Sunny and that  Pappag lives in a mansion in  Gyoverly Hills, where Camie occasionally visits to bring him clams. When they arrive in  Mermaid Cove, they meet the rest of Camie's mermaid friends, which makes Sanji cry with happiness and say that he has found his " All Blue." A few of the mermaids find the barrel where Caribou is stored and suggest opening it. Meanwhile, at  Noah, Hammond reports Luffy's arrival to his boss, who orders his crew to bring Luffy to him.

Luffy's group gets acquainted with the mermaids. Sanji happily swims with them while Luffy, Usopp, Chopper, and Camie relax. Chopper and Usopp comment that Sanji seems to have gotten better, to which the former mentions that he is out of blood packs and that Sanji's blood type is rather rare. Luffy then asks Camie if he could see  Jinbe, mentioning that Jinbe saved him after  Ace died. However, Camie tells him that Jinbe left the island with the  Fish-Man Pirates since he revoked his title as a  Warlord of the Sea and that so much on the island has changed since then. Before she can go into detail, the quintuplets come rushing to them, telling them that a royal gondola is headed their way, possibly to arrest the Straw Hats. The mermaids hide Luffy's group as the three princes from the Neptune House of the  Ryugu Kingdom arrive. The princes are  Fukaboshi, a shark merman;  Ryuboshi, an oarfish merman; and  Manboshi, a moonfish merman.

They ask the mermaids about the Straw Hats' illegal entry and if they have seen them. The mermaid denies seeing any intruders while Hammond and his men are in the area searching for Luffy. The mermaid holding Sanji triggers his perverted nature, and he squirts out a huge nosebleed, giving the Straw Hats away. The  Ammo Knights set upon the group, but Chopper pleads with them to halt their arrest until he can cure Sanji. Chopper, Usopp, and Luffy frantically ask if anyone could donate some blood to save Sanji's life. The mermaids, strangely, become hesitant to help. Hammond shows himself, explaining that it is against the rules to share their blood with humans, and in return for doing so, fish-men will be silenced by a "judgement in the dark."

This rule stems from the death of  Fisher Tiger, who apparently died bleeding after a battle and could have been easily saved with a transfusion, but no humans were willing to help him. Hammond then commands Luffy to come with him before resorting to trying to capture him with a net. Luffy dodges it and hits Hammond and his lackeys with a  knocking them out. The sea monster that Hammond brought with him tries to attack Luffy, but the Straw Hat captain uses  Haki to subdue the beast. The beast calms down before it can even reach Luffy, which shocks Usopp. Camie appears unexpectedly on a gondola (owned by the princes), calling for Luffy and the others to board, and explains that there is a port in town with humans who may be able to assist them. Luffy's group does so, and they take off. Camie also mentions that it has been a while since humans have come down to Fish-Man Island. The Straw Hats are the first guests that they have had in a while. She also mentions that there are rumors of some big shadow moving around the kingdom and preventing humans from reaching the island.

Back at Mermaid Cove, the mermaids apologize for hiding the Straw Hats, but the princes reveal that it was a misunderstanding. They did not come to arrest the group but rather to give them a message from Jinbe before he left the island.

In the port town of  Coral Hill, Luffy's group takes shelter in Madam Shyarly's Mermaid Cafe.  Shyarly, a  shortfin mako shark mermaid, provides them a room where they can treat Sanji. Fortunately, Luffy's group locates blood donors for Sanji. The group is relieved that Sanji regains consciousness. Horrified, Sanji finds out that his blood donors are two  okama pirate twins named  Splash and Splatter. Chopper then examines Luffy's arm and realizes that he was  poisoned when he attacked Hammond's group. However, due to his encounter with  Magellan, Luffy's body developed antibodies that fought against the poison, which saved his life. Luffy remarks that the octopus merman swordsman that was with Hammond blocked his attack and nicked him in the process, suggesting that he must be skilled.

Back at Mermaid Cove, the aforementioned blue-ringed poisonous octopus merman named  Hyouzou is seen carrying his unconscious shipmates back to their hideout. Hyouzou hears a scream and comments that the mermaids are noisy. He also remembers that he accidentally poisoned Luffy when the latter struck him. Hyouzou goes on to say that it would be bad if Luffy died, unaware that he had developed an immunity to poison. At the cove, the mermaids realize that the scream came from some of their friends, including a mermaid named  Ishilly. A barrel was opened, and their missing friends are nowhere to be found.

Back at the Mermaid Cafe, Camie introduces Luffy and Usopp to the owner, Madam Shyarly. Camie asks Shyarly to not let Sanji see her or know that he is in the backroom of the Mermaid Cafe. When Luffy and Usopp notice a large crystal ball, Shyarly mentions that she used to be a fortune teller but quit because she decided to leave the future unknown. Luffy asks Shyarly if mermaids can poop. Shyarly responds by angrily saying how vulgar Luffy is, and Luffy quickly apologizes. Shyarly lets Camie take the day off to show Luffy and Usopp around town. Camie then remembers that she needs to go visit Pappag and deliver clams. Shyarly informs Camie that Pappag is in the cafe. The three head to the front of the cafe and run right into Brook and Pappag, who were just leaving. Pappag invites them to his house for the day to celebrate their arrival on Fish-Man Island. En route, Brook spots a wanted poster for Vander Decken. Pappag and Camie explain to the group that Vander Decken is a notorious bandit in the area who is smitten with the Mermaid Princess. He started sending love letters, then packages, and then threatening marriage proposals. This prompted King Neptune and the princes to form an army to search for Vander Decken, but they have not had any luck finding him. When Brook asks about the legend surrounding Decken, Pappag reveals that it was just an exaggeration of the myth and that the Vander Decken from the legend died on Fish-Man Island. The one running around is his descendant, Vander Decken IX.

As they finish the story, Luffy notices the different colors and sizes of the residents of Fish-Man Island. He sees that one of the fish-men has a mermaid child. Pappag states that when a fish-man and mermaid marry, their offspring can be either one of the two, hence the variety of their species. As the group heads for a highway, they spot a candy factory with a pirate flag on it. Pappag explains that it belongs to  Charlotte Linlin, a.k.a. "Big Mom" of the  Four Emperors, who has taken over as the protector of the island after  Whitebeard's death. In return, the island must produce candy for her every month.

Luffy wonders if he will meet her someday and comments that she is a nice person to take over Whitebeard's role. Pappag, however, seems unconvinced as Whitebeard never asked for collateral and assumes that Big Mom is seeing her protection from a business perspective. Soon, the group reaches Gyoverly Hills and sees Pappag's mansion upon arrival.

Back in Coral Hill, Shyarly is suddenly causing a commotion and screaming in the street after seeing a prediction on her crystal ball. She warns of a person wearing a straw hat and yells that they must get him to leave. She assumes this person to be Luffy and cries out that he will destroy Fish-Man Island.

#### The Next Generation of Danger: Unrest and Trouble on the Island[]

Back in the Noah District, a group of pirates are fleeing back to their ship. Their captain, "Crab Hand"  Gyro, comments how they were strong-armed into serving the New Fish-Man Pirates. We then go to the leader and officers of the said pirates: Officers  Dosun (a  hammerhead shark),  Zeo (a  Japanese wobbegong),  Daruma (a  cookiecutter shark),  Ikaros Much (a  giant squid), and their captain,  Hody Jones (a  great white shark). A member of the New Fish-Man Pirates informs Hody and the officers about Gyro's escape. Hody tells his crew that he will take care of it, taking a batch of pills that suddenly increase his strength.

Meanwhile, Luffy's group marvels at Pappag's house. They enter  Criminal, a clothing store, and on the first floor, they find a customer complaining about the prices of the clothes. The customer turns out to be Nami. Nami scolds Pappag for the high prices and demands a discount. As a thank you for their help on Sabaody, Pappag allows the group to have whatever they want for free. After hearing this joyful news, the pirates quickly empty the store, to Pappag's dismay. Unrest suddenly arises outside the shop, and the group rushes out to see why. A figure on a whale comes towards them, revealing himself as the "Sea God"  Neptune, a  coelacanth merman, riding on his whale,  Hoe. Camie and Pappag are shocked by his presence. Neptune approaches the group and invites Luffy and the Straw Hats to his palace, much to everyone's surprise.

Meanwhile, Gyro and his crew continue with their escape. Before they can get very far, Hody appears in front of them, handcuffed, and drills inside the ship. He emerges under the deck while chomping down on a pirate. Despite all the efforts of the crew, Hody continues to destroy the ship and crew with his jaws alone. As Hody continues with his rampage, the New Fish-Man Pirates remark about the pills called  Energy Steroids, which double the user's strength for each dose. However, in exchange for the boost in strength, the drug shaves away the user's lifespan. Because they do not fear death, the fish-men disregard the negative side effect. The pirates on the ship realize that Hody has handcuffed himself to show that he does not need his hands to destroy them.

After wrecking the pirates' ship and leaving them barely alive, Hody tells them to return to the surface to tell the humans about what happened and who is responsible. As Gyro and his crew float to the surface, Hody declares that the New Fish-Man Pirates will show the world that fish-men are the supreme race and that they will take control of Fish-Man Island from King Neptune.

A few hours earlier, Ishilly and two other unwitting mermaids began opening the barrel that Caribou was sealed in, thinking that the barrel contained treasure or expensive alcohol. After Ishilly loosens a few bolts, Caribou pops out and terrifies the three mermaids. As the unfortunate mermaids try to flee and scream for help, Caribou captures them within himself using his Numa Numa no Mi powers, which allow him to become and create an artificial swamp. He then gleefully comments that since he is on the island, he can capture as many mermaids as he wishes and sell them into  slavery.

Back in the present, the Ammo Knights question the mermaids about the Straw Hats, suspecting them of the kidnappings, although they are stumped as to why they would do something like that after acting so friendly. Fukaboshi questions Madam Shyarly if she is certain about the prediction she made. When she confirms it, Fukaboshi comments that they will have to "deal" with the problem as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, Luffy's group rides on  Megalo while King Neptune rides on Hoe, leaving Gyoverly Hills. Neptune mentions that Megalo, the shark that was freed from the Kraken earlier, is his daughter's pet. The princess was worried heavily about her beloved pet and cried continuously until Megalo returned. He wishes to thank the Straw Hats with a banquet at his palace. Neptune also mentions that he has his soldiers looking for the rest of the crew. Zoro was found earlier and is already at the palace drinking, while Nami reveals that Franky went to look for a relative of  Tom's and Robin went to look up something historical. Nami then asks Neptune about the light of the island so far beneath the sea. The king reveals that it comes from the roots of the  Sunlight Tree Eve. It is the only spot on the ocean where light shines down. The fish-men built their island underneath, so it allows light and air to flow down. The group then reaches the  Ryugu Palace and heads inside, where Neptune is scolded by his ministers for going out haphazardly. They also mention that they have a message from Fukaboshi. As the ministers speak with Neptune, Camie, Pappag, and the Straw Hats realize that Luffy has wandered off.

Luffy follows the scent of food, trying to find the banquet hall. The smell leads him to a door, where a guard is just coming from. Luffy wanders inside, finding the room pitch black but able to see the food on the other side of the room. He heads for it while noticing that the ground is rather odd, especially a rather bouncy section (which he believes to be pudding). However, someone shouts, and the lights turn on, revealing the ground to be a person's body, with the bouncy part being her breasts. The person turns out to be Princess  Shirahoshi, a giant  smelt-whiting mermaid. She tries to put on a brave face after seeing Luffy, thinking him to be an assassin, before crying out for her father and brothers.

Meanwhile, Vander Decken IX (a Japanese bullhead shark fish-man) and his crew, the  Flying Pirates, are traveling the ocean floor. Decken angrily asks Wadatsumi if they have received any reply from Shirahoshi. When Wadatsumi answers that she has not replied for the past ten years, Decken throws an axe with a rose on it as a message. Decken then states that she must either marry him or die if she chooses someone else.

Back at the palace, Shirahoshi continues to cry, with Luffy trying to calm her down. The axe Decken had thrown earlier flies into the room, straight for the Princess. Luffy spots it in time and manages to knock it away, saving Shirahoshi. The guards and the  Minister of the Right enter the room a moment later. Shirahoshi grabs Luffy and hides him behind her back, telling the guards that she just had a bad dream. They accept the explanation before telling the princess of the suspicions toward the Straw Hats due to the mermaid disappearances and Madame Shyarly's vision of Luffy destroying Fish-Man Island.

The Minister of the Right erroneously states that they have captured Zoro and are about to capture Nami, Usopp, and Brook as well. They leave the room to continue searching for Luffy. Once they have left, Shirahoshi apologizes to Luffy for her outburst after realizing he was the one to save Megalo. They talk while Luffy eats some of her food. Shirahoshi reveals that Decken has a "curse" known as " Mato-Mato," which allows him to target anything from any location. As such, it is unsafe for her to go outside, and she has been locked up in the  Hard-Shell Tower for ten years.

Shirahoshi becomes fascinated with Luffy, wondering how such a small person like Luffy can eat so much. The princess pokes his stuffed cheek, and Luffy yells at her for this, causing her to break down in tears instantly. The princess states that no one had ever yelled at her before. Luffy bluntly says that he does not like her for her crybaby tendencies, causing her to cry even more. Luffy finishes eating and asks if she would like to go for a walk outside, offering to protect her if anything is thrown at her.

Usopp, Nami, and Brook are then seen after they subdued some of the Neptune Guards. Camie pleads with them not to fight anymore, but Usopp claims that the guards were the ones who attacked them out of the blue and that, whatever the reason, they will defend themselves. The  Minister of the Left begs Neptune to use his power. Neptune does not wish to go against the pirates just because of a prediction, but decides to capture them. Neptune attacks, but Zoro intercepts him, having broken out of his prison upon hearing the "party" going on.

Back in the Noah District, Decken arrives and goes to meet Hody. The two shake hands (though not before Decken puts a glove on to prevent his Devil Fruit from marking Hody as a target), symbolizing their joining of forces to bring down the Ryugu Kingdom.

Back at the palace, Usopp chastises Zoro for going too far after the group has defeated and chained up Neptune, his ministers, and the Ammo Knights. Usopp states that they plan to intimidate the guards and run off when they got the chance. Usopp is annoyed when Nami asks one of the guards the location of the Treasury and is further annoyed when Brook suggests singing. Neptune mentions that he is no longer a fighter and has grown too old to do so since his back gave out. The group wonders about Luffy and where he has gone. Zoro suggests that they grab the Sunny and flee, but Usopp says the coating bubble broke when they crashed into the island, so they can't. Nami also notices the  Log Pose is going haywire and cannot lock on anything. One of the ministers mocks her for this, and when she asks why, he agrees to tell her only if she unties him.

The doorbell to the palace rings, signaling the return of the princes. Zoro picks up the Den Den Mushi and answers, claiming that they have hostages. Zoro manages to bargain for the hostages' freedom in exchange for them finding the rest of the Straw Hats and coating their ship so they can leave peacefully. Fukaboshi agrees to the demands and reveals the message that Jinbe left. The messages are "Do not fight Hody" and "I'll be waiting in the  Sea Forest." Back at Coral Hill, the news of the Straw Hats' actions has reached the residents' ears. The Ammo Knights try to arrest Sanji and Chopper. Chopper attacks the knights with his new . Sanji then questions the guards, asking if the Mermaid Princess is at the palace. When they confirm it, Sanji tells Chopper that he is going to head to the palace. Chopper scolds Sanji, saying that if the Mermaid Princess is beautiful, he will die instantly.

At Hard-Shell Tower, Luffy offers Shirahoshi the chance to head outside, asking where she would like to go. Shirahoshi mentions the Sea Forest, but comments that she is too scared and breaks down again when Luffy calls her a weakling. The tower is suddenly bombarded again, and Luffy realizes it is Vander Decken IX. In the palace hall, the king hears the sounds and commands the Straw Hats to go check on the princess to ensure her safety. When Zoro asks why they should take orders from hostages, Neptune responds angrily, saying that if his daughter is harmed while he is incapacitated, he will chase the Straw Hats to the ends of the ocean. Brook quickly dashes off to her location while bringing the Minister of the Right since the latter demands it. The two reach the tower and find that human pirates (pawns of Hody Jones) were thrown into the tower. The minister realizes that it could be a surprise attack. Before Brook can do anything, Megalo suddenly breaks out of the tower (with Shirahoshi hiding in his mouth and Luffy riding on top) and heads for the Sea Forest.

Brook and the minister yell to both Luffy and Megalo as they leave the tower, but neither hears them. The minister tells Brook to hurry into the room to check on the princess. But once they get there, Shirahoshi is nowhere to be found. The minister panics, saying that this is a national crisis. One of the pirates goes on to attack Brook, demanding to know the location of the switch that opens the connection corridor that links the palace to Fish-Man Island. The pirates say that they have to find it, or they will be killed. Back at Coral Hill, Chopper complains to Sanji about beating up the Ammo Knights. Sanji counters that they were going to handcuff him, and that Chopper attacked them first before complimenting the new .

Chopper then dances around happily until the two hear a woman screaming that someone who is bleeding has reached the area and that they need a doctor. Upon reaching the person, they find out that it's Hatchan, heavily wounded with arrows pierced into him. Upon seeing the two, Hatchan warns them of the incoming attack by the New Fish-Man Pirates and that they need to leave.

The story flashes back to a few hours earlier, when Hody Jones and Vander Decken IX were teaming up. Decken goes on to demonstrate his Mato Mato ability. Before he can pick a volunteer, Hatchan appears and objects to the operation. The octopus fish-man then questions why Hyouzou and Decken are going along with the plan when they did not answer Arlong's call when he formed his crew. Hyouzou answers that Arlong was too cheap to afford him at the time and that he only cares about money and not the cause of his employers. Decken answers that Arlong tried to make him his underling, which Decken did not take kindly to. Hody then explains that while he respected Arlong, he was too barbaric in his methods, and thus the New Fish-Man Pirates have apparently learned from their mistakes and prepared. When the subject of Luffy being on the island is brought up, Hatchan explains that Luffy saved his life and that he owes him since Luffy is his friend.

Hody shows his disappointment and states that he has lost all hope in Hatchan. Decken then touches Hatchan, saying that he is locked onto him. Decken then demonstrates his power by throwing a knife over Hatchan. It suddenly flies into the octopus, stabbing him in the back. Decken explains that as long as a person remains his target after touching them, what he throws will always fly towards them. He then takes some arrows from a nearby pirate. Hatchan, realizing what he is about to do, yells at Hody to call him off, but Hody dismisses Hatchan as too weak and allows Decken to throw the arrows. Hatchan runs for his life and dives into the ocean, but it does him little good, and he gets struck by the arrows.

After this display, Decken continues the explanation, saying that he can only keep two targets in his memory and that his right hand is reserved for Shirahoshi, whom he touched long ago. Hody then tells his captive human pirates the plan. Decken will throw them into the Hard-Shell Tower using his Mato Mato power. When the captive pirates object, Hody threatens to throw them into the ocean if they do not comply. We then go on to the present, where the pirates are searching for the switch. Brook and the Minister of the Right rush back to the others to inform them of the surprise attack and of Shirahoshi's disappearance. Neptune looks stunned. Usopp begins to panic, asking what they should do. Zoro suggests that they should just cut them.

Meanwhile, Luffy, Megalo, and Shirahoshi continue to head for the Sea Forest. Shirahoshi is nervous but excited to be outside for the first time in ten years. Luffy then asks if there is anything fun in the Sea Forest. Shirahoshi replies that there is a grave that she has wanted to visit since it was built. At the Sea Forest, Jinbe sits in front of the grave while commenting on the growth of the princes and the princess still being trapped in the tower in the ten years since the grave's occupant's assassination, but no one has forgotten her ideals. As it turns out, the grave belongs to Queen  Otohime, the wife and mother of the Neptune family.

#### The Coup d'état Commences: Hody and Decken Strike[]

Over the island, a flying com broadcasts the border patrol trying to contact the palace. The com warns the island that some dangerous individuals have left the Fish-Man District though cannot tell what their purpose is. These people turn out to be Hody and Decken's crews riding on a group of sea monsters heading towards the palace. Hody Jones rallies everyone, telling them that they will soon be the new rulers of Fish-Man Island. Meanwhile at a fish bus stop, Robin has subdued several Ammo Knights who were trying to capture her. Robin then rides on a fish bus heading to the Sea Forest, saying that she learned the location of a  Poneglyph that contains information on the  Void Century. Back at the palace, Zoro argues with the Minister of the Left about his methods of dealing with the intruders. Neptune, however, is more worried for Shirahoshi, believing Luffy kidnapped her even correctly guessing that she could have hidden inside Megalo. The palace guards laugh at this saying that this is too bizarre. Nami states that they would not even try to do something like that. Regardless, Neptune refuses to let them leave unless Shirahoshi returns safely. As they are arguing, they fail to notice that one of the defeated pirates' arms is resting on the entrance switch.

Out at the Sea Forest, we find Franky with the Thousand Sunny, talking to an individual who explains that the forest is also a ship graveyard as the debris is brought in from the currents. The person in question is called  Den, a  Bering wolffish merman and Tom's younger brother. Den promises to coat the Sunny for him after hearing it was made from  Adam Wood. Franky admits that he was surprised to find that he and Tom looked nothing alike. Den explains that fish-men and mermen have old genes in them so if for example, a shark mermaid was born from an octopus mermaid, that would mean his ancestor was a shark. Even so, no one on the island bats an eye about the different types of species. To them, family is family, and the fish-man cannot understand why humans would want to categorize them like that (though Den contradicts himself when he asks if Franky has a robot for an ancestor). Den goes on saying that he knows about Franky and  Iceburg from the letters  Kokoro sent him and knows what happened to Tom. Den comments that Tom picked Franky as the right disciple. Franky then notices Jinbe not far from them, sitting near Otohime's grave. Den mentions that he is waiting for someone since he cannot enter Fish-Man Island due to being a wanted criminal.

Back at the palace, Hody, Decken, and their crews enter the palace which catches Neptune and the Minister of the Right unaware, who mentions that Hody was once a soldier in the Neptune Army. Likewise, Hody and Decken are surprised that the guards and Neptune were already defeated before they got there. The Minister of the Left accuses the Straw Hats of inviting them, but Usopp rebuffs his claim, saying that they (Straw Hats) would not even be in the palace if Neptune had not invited them and ask who the invading fish-men group are. Neptune quickly accuses Vander Decken IX for kidnapping Shirahoshi. Decken states otherwise and is just as surprised when he finds out that Shirahoshi is missing. Hody tells Decken that even if the Mermaid Princess is no longer in the palace, he still has the power to find her. Decken then heads outside, grabs a coral, touches it, and throws it. Seeing it going away from the palace, Decken hops on, promising that if Shirahoshi is with someone else, then she is better off dying in a sea of blood.

Neptune then begs the Straw Hats to save Shirahoshi, claiming her to be his treasure. Hody chuckles at the events he sees before him. The Minster to the Right curses Hody for the chaos he caused in the Fish-Man District, asking if he has no shame as a former soldier in the Neptune Army. Hody rebuttals that he did not care about the position and only sought power and intelligence from it, having been inspired by Arlong's ambition. He had hoped to become "Arlong's Right Arm" when he had taken over the world, but the Straw Hats put an end to that. As he talks, Nami notices the Arlong's tattoo on his arm and becomes visibly shaken by his words. Hody then shows his strength by breaking a part of the palace wall without even taken the Energy Steroids. Water floods into the room and Hody uses water drops as an attack called , forming the water drops into arrows and sending them at the tied-up palace guards, injuring them in the process.

Hody keeps attacking and Neptune dives in the way, shielding the guards from further harm. Hody mocks Neptune for this selflessness, citing that Neptune is unfit to be king. Zoro sends a sword slash at Hody but the latter uses one of his comrades as a shield to block the attack. Zoro tells the others to untie the ropes of the guards, citing that he could not keep the hostages safe as promised so the negotiations are off, showing integrity which the minister comments on with surprise and respect. Brook notices that Nami had run off while Hody orders his men to attack the guards and the Straw Hats. Usopp holds the invaders back by seeding out a  Pop Green that blooms into a flower and sends out a horrible stink. With the water filling up fast and Brook's strength starting to fail, Zoro cuts Neptune's chains asks him to get the others out of the palace while he stays behind to battle Hody. Neptune complies as the palace completely fills with water. Zoro takes a deep breath and prepares to face off against Hody underwater.

Meanwhile, at Coral Hill, the citizens of Fish-Man Island throw accusations at Sanji and Chopper thinking them to be responsible for the mermaid kidnappings. Sanji claims otherwise while Chopper treats Hatchan. Megalo soon floats above the area and Luffy spots Sanji and Chopper. He jumps down to meet them and is surprised at Hatchan's wounded form. One of the Fish-Man Island citizens wonders what Luffy is doing at Coral Hill when he was supposed to be taking over Ryugu Palace. Another citizen thinks that the Straw Hats plan to kidnap the Mermaid Princess, but the others doubt it since Shirahoshi is big and she is under the protection of Neptune. However, Megalo reaches his limit and spits out Shirahoshi right in front of the crowd. The residents instantly interpret this as a Mermaid Princess kidnapping while Chopper warns Sanji not to relapse as he may lose his life this time.

The citizens all begin to go into an uproar over the supposed mermaid kidnapping. Chopper begs Sanji not to turn around or he will surely die. However, seeing the Mermaid Princess is one of his dreams and that he would rather die fulfilling it. Sanji turns around anyway and instantly turns to stone upon seeing Shirahoshi instead of having a nosebleed. Chopper states that it must be some kind of new symptom possibly due to the okama blood transfer. The citizens suddenly pounce on the group and tie up Luffy, Chopper, Sanji, and Hatchan, coming to the defense of Shirahoshi. Hatchan was tied up since one of the fish-men recognizes him as a former member of Arlong's crew. While they're celebrating and preparing to behead the group despite Shirahoshi's pleas that they were not kidnapping her, Luffy spots an object flying towards them.

It turns out to be Vander Decken IX on his flying coral much to the princess's horror. Decken yells out for Shirahoshi to accept his marriage proposal. She bluntly refuses him by citing he "isn't her type" much to his shock. Decken quickly grows angry and prepares to kill her flat out. The citizens plea for Shirahoshi to run away, but Luffy tells her not to as if she gets too far, he cannot protect her. She agrees much to the disapproval of the citizens. Apologizing in advance, Luffy use his  Haoshoku Haki to knock the fish-men out as they are in the way. Luffy then jumps to Decken while still tied up and smashes the coral with his feet. Decken threatens to kill both Shirahoshi and him which Luffy challenges him to try before catching Decken with his legs and slamming him into the ground with a .

With the brief reprieve, Luffy hops to Megalo and wakes him up before asking Chopper about Sanji's condition. Chopper replies that Sanji has reverted to his normal state and is conscious and seems happy. Luffy has Shirahoshi untie him much to the citizens' shock. She apologizes and says that she will be back by dinner. The princess and Luffy's group (along with Hatchan) hop on Megalo and fly away. Decken recovers and calls out to Wadatsumi, who quickly appears on Decken's command. Decken then orders the giant to smash Shirahoshi and her companions. The giant fish-man prepares to attack, but Luffy quickly hits him with a , breaking one of his front teeth. As Wadatsumi cries out in pain, the group head for the Sea Forest.

Back at the Ryugu Palace, Hody is informed that a mermaid (Camie) and a pirate girl (Nami) managed to escape but Hody tells his subordinates to ignore them. Nami, breathing with an air bubble around her head, is seen riding on Camie's back. Nami asks Camie to take her to Jinbe after assuring the mermaid that the others will be alright. Camie complies and the two head for the Sea Forest. Back inside the palace, Neptune and the others have been freed. The guards wish to attack Hody but Neptune stops them, ordering them to let Hody have the palace while they regroup for a counterattack. Usopp worries about Zoro fighting underwater and goes down to check on him. Much to his and Hody crew's surprise, Zoro manages to deal a viciously brutal slash to Hody, striking fear into the shocked fish-man's heart.

With Zoro having just cut Hody Jones. The New Fish-Man Pirates are shocked and one of the pirates shouts not to let Zoro escape and to recharge their strength with Energy Steroids. Neptune then wonders why he is feeling such an odd turmoil around him. Zoro resurfaces gasping for air. Neptune tells the Straw Hats that they must get out of the palace as it will soon be completely flooded. He then orders Zoro to grab onto him. Zoro does so and they go under. Neptune then puts his arms behind his right side, and seemingly grabs the water, saying that what he is about to do will badly hurt his back. He tells the Straw Hats that he is making an escape route for them, so they do not have to fight. The pirates in front of Neptune watch curiously, wondering what Neptune is going to do. Neptune uses his attack,  Merman Combat: Ultramarine and launches a pressurized beam of water at the fish-men in front of him. The blast sends the fish-men flying in all directions. Neptune, while holding his hurt back, tells the soldiers to go. The Ryugu palace guards quickly swim through the gap Neptune made for them. A fish-man pirate frantically swims over to the unconscious Hody Jones and tells him to do something and puts an Energy Steroid pill into his captain's mouth. The ministers and the soldiers have made it out of the palace. Someone gives the order to keep moving and to head inland into Fish-Man Island.

Neptune is flat on his back and Usopp and Brook (who are wearing air bubbles) are trying to convince him to get up. Neptune tells them he is too old to be doing this kind of thing and that his body will not move. Several guards notice the king in need of help, and apparently, so does Hody. Hoe arrives just in time and Neptune grabs a rope around the whale, and Hoe begins to carry him out of the palace. Neptune thanks Hoe, telling him he owes him. Zoro, in the meantime, is about to be out of breath. Neptune then feels something stop him and is jerked back. Hody had grabbed him by the tail. The guards are surprised to see Hody up and moving around as they thought he was incapacitated. They try to help but Neptune turns them away, telling the guards to go and find Fukaboshi and his men. The soldiers are reluctant at first, but the Minister of the Right tells them to obey the king. Zoro is out of air, Usopp is raising his hands in surrender, and Brook seems to have gone limp, and they are captured by the New Fish-Man Pirates.

The scene changes to the Sea Forest, where Luffy is remarking how pretty it is. Shirahoshi is in tears as she thanks Luffy for bringing her there. Chopper decides it is safe for him to take his time to treat Hatchan's wounds. Luffy then sees the Thousand Sunny and Franky and calls out to him. Franky notices Luffy and asks him what he has been doing as he seems to have brought a  pin-up girl (Shirahoshi) with him. Luffy introduces Franky to "Scaredy-Cat," who then properly introduces herself as Shirahoshi. Franky then tells Luffy that Robin came by too. He said that she was looking for something and went into the coral forest. Luffy seems curious, but then Jinbe calls out to him, happy to see him after two years, and commenting that he hardly recognized him.

Luffy is surprised and happy to see Jinbe, as he thought that he would not get to see his friend since he heard Jinbe was not around. This confuses Jinbe, as he thought Luffy came to the forest because of his message. Shirahoshi is also glad to see Jinbe, who comments that Luffy came with the princess, whom he had not heard from in what felt like forever. It then dawns on Jinbe that Shirahoshi is in the Sea Forest and not in her tower. He is so shocked that his eyes bug out of his head. While he is asking why she is in the Sea Forest, Chopper tells Franky that he is going to lower Hatchan down from Megalo and he should be ready to grab him. Jinbe's eyes bug out again at the sight of the injured Hatchan, and asks him how he got his wounds. He then asks him what he is doing on Fish-Man Island since he heard that Hatchan had been captured along with the rest of the Arlong Pirates. Hatchan, still weak from his injuries, asks if Jinbe is the one he is hearing.

Meanwhile, Sanji is completely enthralled by Shirahoshi. He then launches into a poetic metaphor where he is a painter, unable to capture Shirahoshi's beauty, as he dances around her. Chopper is overjoyed by Sanji's reaction to Shirahoshi, as he is behaving the way he normally does around a woman, saying he is back to his weird self again. Den then asks Shirahoshi why she is in the Sea Forest. Before she can answer, Luffy asks Den who he is and what he is doing on the Sunny. Franky then introduces Luffy to Den, saying he agreed to coat the ship as well as his relation to his old master, Tom. Luffy is surprised and asks Franky if his brother really was a coating master (having only comprehended bits and pieces of Den's introduction). Franky tells him he is close enough. Jinbe is then talking to Shirahoshi, saying he understands her reasons for coming, but she must not leave her tower. Both Luffy and Jinbe then notice something in the air. Luffy jumps up and kicks a giant axe that was meant to kill Shirahoshi, redirecting it into the ground. Luffy then comments on how persistent Vander Decken IX is. Jinbe then annoyingly asks Luffy why he brought the princess with him, putting her in such unnecessary danger (although accompanying Luffy is just as safe as being locked in the massive stone tower). Instead of answering Jinbe, Luffy turns to Shirahoshi and tells her that everything is okay with him close to her. Shirahoshi casually replies okay. Jinbe is amazed by how care-free Luffy is.

While everyone is hanging out around the Sunny, Luffy points to Otohime's grave and asks if that was the grave Shirahoshi was talking about, saying she has been in front of it for a long time. Jinbe explains to Luffy that Shirahoshi's mother is resting in that grave. He goes on to say that Shirahoshi had a poorly timed encounter with Vander Decken IX's poison fang ten years ago. She could not even go to her mother's funeral, and she had to stay in the tower. Shirahoshi is praying in front of the grave, telling her mother that there are so many things she wanted to say to her.

Just then, Nami calls out to Luffy. She and Camie have arrived. Camie is surprised to see him with Shirahoshi. Luffy asks Nami if the banquet had started yet while Sanji is overjoyed to see her. With Sanji acting normally, Chopper pronounces that Sanji fully cured (although whether it is due to the okama blood transfusion, or his building up a tolerance to beauty, is left unknown). Nami tells them that Hody Jones is now on the loose. Jinbe is astounded that the Ryugu Palace could fall into such a crisis. Luffy asks what happened to the rest of the crew. Nami tells him that she does not know as she was planning to go back after she found Luffy and Jinbe.

Shirahoshi starts crying over her father's capture while Camie asks Hatchan what happened to him. Jinbe apologizes, saying the Straw Hats had gotten entangled in the situation before he even realized it. He asks if he could explain quickly, saying it is hard to tell Luffy this now, and would have been even harder to tell him two years ago. He tells them that the Arlong Pirates were rampaging all over  East Blue until a group of people put a stop to them. He adds that he has the utmost gratitude for those people, and thanks the Straw Hats. Jinbe adds that he would also like to take this opportunity to apologize. Jinbe then reveals that he was the one who set Arlong loose in East Blue, much to Nami's stunned surprise.

#### Fisher Tiger and Queen Otohime: The Cycle of Hatred and Tragedies of Heroes[]

Back at the palace, the ministers and the palace guards manage to make it outside safely. While worried for their king's welfare, they agree that they need to find the princes. Meanwhile all across the island, The New Fish-Man Pirates led by their officers try to subjugate the people into renouncing Queen Otohime's ideals by stepping on her  fumi-e or be thrown out of the island or suffer violence. In the Water Wheel Village on the north side of the island, Fukaboshi strikes Dosun, angrily demanding to know what they hope to accomplish by forcing the citizens to step on the picture of his late mother. In a Southeast village called Coral Gaoka, the locals are in an uproar about Shirahoshi's supposed kidnapping by the Straw Hats while a nearby Caribou listens and plots to kidnap the princess.

Back in the Sea Forest, Shirahoshi is crying, worried for her father. Jinbe assures her that Hody will not do anything to him yet and Jinbe states that he will save the king. Nami questions Jinbe about setting Arlong into East Blue. Sanji quickly demands Jinbe to explain himself and reveals to him the horror Nami went through when Arlong took over  Cocoyasi Village. The chef adds that what Jinbe says next will decide if he will forgive him or not. After hearing about Nami's past, Jinbe shows remorse. Nami comments that while she will not forgive Arlong, she did not know what the fish-men went through and that while going to rescue Camie from the slave traders, she noticed that  Sabaody Park looked similar to  Arlong Park.

Hatchan does not deny this, mentioning that he and his fellow fish-men did want to live with the humans since they were kids, but Arlong's hatred went a little too far. He explains that 200 years ago, fish-men and mermen separated themselves from the common fish species and the Ryugu Kingdom became a nation of the  World Government, becoming friends with a few humans and even joined in council meetings. However, this did not stop fish-men from being persecuted. The worst period in their history came at the start of the  Great Pirate Age when pirates rampaged through the island. That all came to a stop when Whitebeard claimed Fish-Man Island as his territory, but that too did not stop the discrimination.

Jinbe then explains that two people decided to take a stand: Queen Otohime, who rallied for peace with the humans and Fisher Tiger, who wanted to separate the fish-men and humans and went against the taboo of the world by attacking  Mary Geoise to set the slaves free. Tiger then formed the  Sun Pirates with Jinbe, Hatchan, and Arlong as part of the crew. However, their anti-government crusade clashed with Otohime's quest for peace, bringing both resolutions to a standstill. The story then flashes back 15 years ago as Hatchan reports to Fisher Tiger that they spotted an enemy ship. Tiger inquires if it is the Marines.

The story then goes a little back in time when a fish-man thief was running through town holding a mermaid hostage. However, he was intercepted by the most unlikely person, Queen Otohime. Despite hurting her hand from slapping the thief, she manages to knock him into the ground. Otohime then demand to know why the thief would do something like this. The thief revealed that he had been down on his luck having lost his job after his business burned down and winding up in debt and having ten kids to feed. Otohime chastised him, commenting that was no excuse for his actions as it will just continue the cycle of suffering. Then, she cried for him citing that even though she is a noble and living wealthy, she would like to do more to help her subjects. This moved the thief to tears and he vowed to change his ways as he was taken away by the guards. The residents commented on Otohime's kind nature though they could not help but look on in bewilderment as she slapped a fish-man child for having snot running out of only one of his nostrils.

Later, Otohime preached to her subjects about trying to go to the surface and interact with humans peacefully. She mentioned that the pirates who kidnapped some of their kind were just a fraction of the humans they have interacted with. She asked for the subjects to sign their name on a petition to migrate with her. The residents declined and Jinbe watched on from a distance and commented to himself that the queen's efforts were useless, and that history speak only for the humans. Otohime soon returned home to her family, tired but still optimistic. Neptune knew well about the dangerous nature of her quest for peace with the humans as their ancestors tried it, but the effort only ended in vain. He asked the Minister of the Left to protect her the best he can.

One day, one of the guards went to check on a disturbance caused by Arlong who was bullying one of the residents who had one of Otohime's signed up papers. When the guard tried to stop Arlong only to find himself in his grasp. The guard called out to Jinbe, who at the time was in the Neptune Army, to help. Jinbe calmly and sternly told Arlong to leave the soldier alone and give the papers back even though he did not care about Otohime's cause but knows it's important to her. Arlong gruffly obliged calling Jinbe his "brother" since they grew up as orphans in the Fish-Man District together. Jinbe just called him scum since Arlong was acting like a pirate. They suddenly hear that Fisher Tiger has come back into town and the two went to greet him. It is then revealed that the Fish-Man District started out as a home for orphans, but over time it became corrupted due to its evil managers. Soon, the Fish-Man District turned into a haven for Fish-Man Island's outcasts. Tiger, Jinbe, Arlong, and  Macro were all residents there and eventually, they went on their separate ways as they grew up: Tiger became an adventurer, Jinbe enlisted into the Neptune Army, Arlong became a pirate, and Macro became a kidnapper of his own kind.

Soon the news of Tiger's act of attacking Mary Geoise reached Fish-Man Island. With the fish-men slaves he freed, Tiger formed the Sun Pirates. Jinbe resigned from his post and Arlong gathered his pirate crew to join Tiger as well. The story then moves to the time after Hatchan spotted the Marine ship. The aftermath of the battle is then shown with the Sun Pirates completely decimated the Marines.

All across Fish-Man Island, the residents cheered for Tiger after learning what he did at Mary Geoise. A brief flashback shows Tiger himself going to Neptune and telling what he seen in the surface world, shocking both the king and queen. Queen Otohime instantly cried upon hearing the atrocities the humans were doing to fish-men. After the news of Tiger's stunt, Neptune doubted that they can attend a council meeting with the island in such an uproar. Otohime was understanding of Tiger's action, citing that his heart "rose up to a giant cry." Regardless, Otohime continued to try to get her subjects to migrate with her, but the citizens were as doubtful as ever. Meanwhile in the Fish-Man District, young Hody Jones and the future officers of the New Fish-Man Pirates had found out about Tiger's exploits and cheered on the Sun Pirates, thinking that their goal was to destroy humans.

Meanwhile on the Grand Line, the Sun Pirates encountered yet another marine ship and easily took down its crew.  Rear Admiral  Kadar called out to Tiger, demanding him to give back the ex-slaves. Tiger countered him saying that he had no proof that there were such people on his ship. The Sun Pirates then looted the ship. Tiger then sees Arlong about to murder a marine, under the reasoning for simply being a human. Tiger shouted for him to stop. At  Marineford,  Strawberry is reporting to  Vice Admiral  Borsalino (Kizaru), about Kadar's ship being sunk despite orders for it to just recon and come back. Strawberry stated that they were able to identify Arlong and Tiger and label them as very powerful which "worried" Borsalino.

Back with the Sun Pirates, Tiger chastised Arlong and Jinbe for their brutal actions against their opponents. Jinbe stated that the Marines were trying to kill him, but Tiger firmly stated that he will not kill out of hatred and told his crew that his ultimate goal was to break the iron clad rules of the world and freeing the oppressed. Tiger went on saying that killing senselessly would just make them as bad as the humans that oppressed them. He also stated that if they started acting out of revenge, the humans will just respond in kind in an endless cycle. Arlong, however, suggested that they should kill humans to the point where they will fear fish-men and will not want to retaliate. Jinbe smacked Arlong on the head to shut him up.

That night, Tiger confided to Jinbe about what the difference he thought Otohime would see in Arlong and him and that the demons that dwell in his (Tiger's) heart was the truly terrifying one. And so it went, Otohime would try to get her subjects to sign her petition and Tiger and his Sun Pirates continued sailing the seas. Tiger and Jinbe soon received bounties of 230,000,000 and 76,000,000 respectively (which annoys Arlong that he was ignored by the Marines). Three years have passed since the Mary Geoise incident, and the Sun Pirates landed on an island where the natives request that they take a former slave named  Koala with them to return her to her homeland. They explained that she managed to escape from Mary Geoise during Tiger's raid and ended up on their island.

Tiger obliged though Arlong showed his contempt as soon as Koala boarded their ship, even hitting her since she smiled all the time. Koala suddenly pulled out a rag and started cleaning the floor, saying she will do anything to keep them happy and apologized profusely. Jinbe then asked her if she was afraid of them. Koala stated that she is but wants to see her mother again, so she gathered the courage to come aboard their ship, begging them not to kill her. One of the Sun Pirates explained that the lifestyle of a slave has been integrated into her body. If they cried or took a break, they will be killed by their owner. Soon, being on guard all the time became a reflex.

Tiger soon saw this and ordered Koala to be taken to his room. He then branded Koala with the Sun symbol, stating it was a necessary measure to free her of her burden. Koala awakened and apologized for passing out and once again said that she will not cry. Tiger yelled at her, saying that she was allowed to cry if she wished and told her that he is not the same as the  Celestial Dragons. He then took his gun and threw it overboard, stating once more that he will not kill anyone. Tiger then ordered his crew that they are going to take Koala home no matter what. Upon hearing this, Koala finally cried.

Some time passed and the Sun Pirates managed to get a hold of an  Eternal Pose to Koala's home island. They even get Koala some new clothes and a haircut. Koala was understandably nervous and continued cleaning the ship while  Aladine, the merman who explained about her slave upbringing, told the others to leave her be since it takes a while for trauma to be forgotten. Arlong however continued to remain antagonistic towards her, firmly believing that all humans are alike and that she would turn against them as she grew older. Jinbe thinks otherwise, telling Arlong that not all humans think the same and that they seem to be afraid of fish-men. When Jinbe asked Koala if it was because they are pirates, Koala answered it is because humans do not know anything about fish-men. This makes Jinbe realize that this is the exact reason fish-men fear the humans. Days passed on the ship and Koala was treated nicely by the pirates. Soon the ship reached Koala's home island,  Foolshout Island. Tiger offered to take Koala to her hometown as the Sun Pirates wished her well as she headed off, with her promising to tell the good things about them. Soon they reached her village and Koala was reunited with her mother.

Tiger then starts to head back to the ship but was suddenly ambushed by the Marines led by Rear Admiral Strawberry. Strawberry told Tiger that the islanders offered him up in exchange for them overlooking Koala being a former slave. The Sun Pirates heard the commotion but before they can rush to his aid, their ship was attacked by surrounding Marine ships. They jumped into the ocean to escape the destruction of their ship. A group of them led by Jinbe went to help Tiger while Arlong and his group captured a Marine ship for their escape. In the village, Koala heard the gunfire and asked her mother about it, but her mother said that it was nothing.

The Sun Pirates succeeded in escaping, but Tiger was critically wounded and in need of a blood transfusion. The ship had human blood in stock that was compatible with their own. As Aladine prepared the transfusion, Tiger refused it, explaining that he did not want the blood of hatred running through his veins. Slowly dying, Tiger gave his last words to his crew, revealing that in his previous adventure he was actually captured and made a slave by the Celestial Dragons, experiencing firsthand "Human Madness." He managed to escape but could not leave the other slaves to suffer so he went back to free them. Tiger lamented on not listening to what Otohime was talking about and that the ones who can change the future for the better are the ones like Koala who know nothing of about the discrimination.

He begged his crew mates not to tell Fish-Man Island of what happened on that day, nor of their rage toward humans or him being a former slave. He knew that there are kind-hearted humans out there but if things keep going as they are, all there will be left is hatred. It was this reasoning that he felt that his body will reject the human blood if given to him and that no matter how hard he tried, he could never love a human. Aladine comforted him with the knowledge that the slaves he freed will all owe him a huge debt of gratitude and that they will forever hail him as a great hero. Happy to hear this, Tiger died from his wounds and his crew grieved his passing.

Sometime later, Arlong returned to Foolshout Island with the intent to take revenge on the villagers for their part in Fisher Tiger's death. However, he was intercepted by Borsalino and easily defeated. When asked why he came back, Arlong mentioned the death of Fisher Tiger. Borsalino showed indifference to the news and took Arlong with him.

Arlong was then taken to  G-2 where he ranted that Tiger died as there was no fish-man blood for him and blaming humans for his death. This news makes it into the papers and the Sun Pirates, now under the command of Jinbe, reluctantly agree that the false story will be better for Tiger's honor. The Sun Pirates continue on spending their days fighting without killing anyone. The Marines soon recognize Jinbe's strength. Jinbe himself sends Neptune a letter explaining the truth about Tiger's death. Hearing this, Otohime becomes more determined to achieve her goal. She continues her speeches and trying to get signatures, but the citizens are even more reluctant after Tiger's death. The days continues on with Otohime helping shipwrecked survivors, teaching the children of Fish-Man Island about the surface world and trying to get people to sign her petition. Then one day while doing her usual rounds, a group of fish-men and mermen asked to cancel their names from the list and pretty soon, all of the signatures were canceled. The citizens even asked her to stop with her speeches.

Otohime became distressed by this, trying to put a brave front for her family but crying to herself when she was alone. Shortly after, she got herself drunk and took over the island's intercom, chastising the citizens for their cowardice and ranting how their children would sneak off to see the surface world. She states that they cannot keep themselves on the ocean floor forever and if humans are the barrier, they must try to overcome this fear for their future generations. Meanwhile with the Sun Pirates, Jinbe receives a letter from the government inviting him to become a Warlord of the Sea.

Chew suggests taking an opportunity to make an infamous name for themselves, but Jinbe decides to take the offer. He returns to Fish-Man Island and explains his plan to King Neptune, citing that it will grant pardons for the Sun Pirates and strengthen the bond between species. Jinbe admits the trouble that his crew caused for Otohime and wishes to support her, figuring it is what Tiger would have wanted. In the throne room, Hody, now fully grown and in the Neptune Army, listens intently. Upon his induction, all of Jinbe's crewmates are granted immunity through his Warlord status, which allows the liberated slaves a semblance of freedom - at the cost of unshackling Arlong as well. After his release, Arlong shows his resentment to Jinbe for becoming a "government dog" and states that he is going back to being captain of the Arlong Pirates (with Hatchan,  Kuroobi and Chew) and intends to take others loyal to him along, some former slaves included, splitting the Sun Pirates into two factions. At an island, Arlong challenges Jinbe to stop him.

When Arlong cites that he will be the rage of the fish-men, Jinbe beats him senseless for the disrespect but nevertheless lets him go. Jinbe is dismayed that Arlong will not respect Tiger's final words. Aladine comforts Jinbe, saying that he understands why Jinbe could not stop Arlong back then. Knowing that trying to do things by force never works out and that either the Marines will stop him, or they (the Sun Pirates) might have to if it comes down to it. The Sun Pirates now completely scattered, Jinbe's crew and Arlong's crew remained severed along with a third faction of Macro and his two associates returning to their old slave trading ways.

Meanwhile back at Fish-Man Island, they receive a report that a shipwrecked ship is coming toward the island, but the cause for alarm is that there is a World Noble on board. Otohime tells them to let the ship in and to put an emergency response unit to the coast. She then dashes off to Fish-Man Island main entrance. The ship arrives at the entrance, where a crowd of fish-men and merfolk have gathered. A World Noble named  Mjosgard crawls out from the wreckage and starts shooting at them, demanding to have a mask despite being heavily wounded and all his crew now dead. Mjosgard continues on demanding a doctor but insults the Fish-Man Island citizens as well. The soldiers wonder what to do and Hody suggests that they should kill him since he is the worst of humankind. Not far from the area, Vander Decken IX and his two henchmen approach the harbor.

We then get a small flashback revealing why Mjosgard came to the island. His father told him that Jinbe is now a Warlord of the Sea and that the slaves that once belong to him returned to Fish-Man Island. Mjosgard decided to go to the island to reclaim them. Back in the current time, some of the Sun Pirates come out of the crowd and confront him. Mjosgard tries to throw his authority at them revealing that they were once his slaves, but they just point their guns at him. Some of the citizens try to convince them to stop since that will upset the pardon Jinbe made for their release. The pirates counter that on the surface, the World Nobles have Marine  Admirals backing them. If they killed Mjosgard right on Fish-Man Island and the Fish-Man Island citizens keep quiet about it, it would just be classified as a shipwreck accident. The citizens realize that they are right and start calling for Mjosgard's death.

Just as one of the Sun Pirates about to pull the trigger, Otohime dashes in and manages to shield Mjosgard, taking the bullet for him though it only grazes her arm. She orders the pirates to throw down their guns as there are children watching. Jinbe and Aladine arrive on the scene with Shirahoshi and her brothers in tow. The Sun Pirates ask Otohime why she protected him despite knowing what he done to them. Otohime answers that she understands how they feel from the voices of their hearts (she possessed the  Kenbunshoku Haki ability and had heightened empathy) but they should not pass on such hatred to their children. Jinbe realizes it is exactly what Fisher Tiger wished of his crew not to do for the sake of their island.

Mjosgard however recovers, grabs her and threatens to shoot her. Just when it seems he's going to shoot her. Shirahoshi cries out for her mother, which echoes over the island and summons massive Sea Kings to the area much to the shock of everyone, Otohime especially. Mjosgard faints at the sight of the creatures saving Otohime while Vander Decken who was watching is overjoyed at seeing such an ability. Revealing that there was a legend of a Mermaid Princess who had such an ability and that it is what his ancestor were seeking, having managed to find it himself. His crew start to congratulate him, but Decken tells them to keep quiet as he thinks they are the only one who know the meaning behind this newfound power. Decken then starts plotting to make Shirahoshi his. Otohime then request to Aladine to heal Mjosgard which he complies. Weeks pass and Mjosgard was soon healed and set to leave. However, Mjosgard is nothing but ungrateful to the fish-men, and angrier for the fact they pointed a gun at him. Otohime appears, however, and asks to accompany him. The citizens as well as Neptune are shocked at such an idea. Neptune even wishing to go in her place. However, she calms everyone down by simply asking to trust her, explaining that a weak diplomat can represent peace much easier than a massive musclebound warrior. With great reluctance, they agree to her wishes, and she travels topside with the World Noble. The whole island goes into a state of unease during her away time, worrying about her welfare.

Then finally she returned, after much negotiation with the World Nobles and much appreciation of the island, holding a piece of paper that was said to be the "Light of Hope" for Fish-Man Island, a document granting the fish-men a place at the  Levely once again. As all this happens, we get a little flashback of more of Vander Decken and his crew talking about the treasure of the Ryugu Kingdom. His crew mention the  Tamatebako which supposedly could make anyone grow. Decken gets excited until his crew mention that they cannot get into the palace unless he was married to Shirahoshi. Decken then starts scheming to marry Shirahoshi to get the treasure of the Ryugu family which is what his ancestors have been after for years. Meanwhile, Otohime shows the paper to her subjects, telling them that she managed to convince a World Noble to give the fish-men their backing for the relations of fish-men and humans. The only thing she needs now are the signatures to make it happen and ask her subjects for their support. At first the people are hesitant but little by little they start adding their names to the list. Soon hundreds of fish-men are signing their names. So much so that they need a bigger basket to hold them all. Otohime is touched by all of this and soon start crying tears of joy to see her dream coming true after seven years of hardship.

Otohime then speaks with her sons in private, telling them of the feat Shirahoshi managed with the Sea Kings. She further explains to them that mermaids have the ability to speak to fish but could never do so with Sea Kings. However, every few centuries a mermaid is born with such an ability. There is also a legend that someone will appear to guide the mermaid and that the world will soon change. The princes are astonished at such a story, but their mother warns them that such a power in the wrong hands can sink the world. As Shirahoshi is still quite young, she is not aware of this power nor can control it and another outburst could destroy the whole island. Otohime then tells the princes to become strong warriors so they can look after their sister which the three wholeheartedly agree without hesitation, ready to lay down their lives to save her and help contain her outbursts.

Then one day without warning, the signatures were mysteriously burned in its box. The soldiers manage to save as much as they can but, in the confusion, a shot suddenly rings out. A first nobody pays it any mind, until they find out Otohime is bleeding from her chest, and she doubles over. Jinbe, Aladine and the soldiers clear out the plaza while trying to find the shooter. The princes and Shirahoshi rush to their mother's side. As they do, Vander Decken uses the chaos to touch Shirahoshi's shoulder before being ushered away. Despite medical attention being summon, Otohime lays dying in the plaza center. Fukaboshi swears to find the killer, but Otohime stops him. She comforts her children, asking them not to let hate and bitterness consume them. Manboshi and Ryuboshi start dancing despite their grief, telling their mother they will protect Shirahoshi. Fukaboshi adds they will collect the signatures and become warriors to protect their sister. Otohime is glad to hear it and with her remaining strength does the pinky promise with her children before she passes away.

Jinbe and the guards manage to find the shooter, Hody getting to him first and revealing that it was an unnamed human. He climbs a tower and reveals this to the whole island much to the shock of the citizens. When Neptune finds out about this, he locks himself in the tower to suppress his killing rage. As he does, he confines to the Minister of the Left that even though they shot the shooter and caught him, Otohime would not want him to avenge her as he does not wish to spread his hatred to the children of the island. And that even if he wanted to, he could not bring himself to kill the human. He feels that as a soldier, since he avenged and took prisoner many humans, he was not quantified to help Otohime with her cause only to watch over her. It because of this he feels he cannot take up Otohime's cause since he would be contradicting himself. Though he admits that the contradicting of their hearts is the one thing humans and fish-men have in common.

The day of the Otohime's funeral arrives, but before the Ryugu family are about to leave. Shirahoshi shows her father a love letter from Decken, proclaiming it would not stop following her. When Neptune finds out who Decken is, he orders his kids to stay at the castle for fear that the shooter may have accomplices and orders the guards to find Decken. At the Sea Forest, nearly the whole island is in attendance at Otohime's funeral. Fukaboshi broadcast his eulogy from the castle via a televised  Den Den Mushi, telling the citizens he knows their hearts are in turmoil at the loss of their queen but that he and his siblings will continue carrying out Otohime's wishes. Restarting the signature signing so that they may attend Levely even if it took them many years to accomplish and urges the rest of the island to do the same to make their mother's dream a reality.

The flashback ends as Jinbe tells them it's been ten years since then and the siblings managed to gather many signatures with Neptune and Shirahoshi appealing to the masses even through the island been battling discrimination for 16 years. Jinbe closes by taking responsibility for Arlong, claiming he wanted to stop him if he heard he was doing any ill-doing but the Marines Arlong had bought off kept information from reaching Marine Headquarters thus Jinbe did not know of his actions. Sanji angrily demands that Jinbe do seppuku (suicide) to atone for his mistake, but Nami stops him. Even though Jinbe is humbly willing to take any punishment from her, she states that she does not blame him, only Arlong, and that Jinbe is a friend of Luffy's.

Plus, that she has no resentment to fish-men, so Jinbe does not need to apologize to her. These words touch Jinbe and Hatchan to tears with the former stating he indebted to them. Franky starts crying as usual after hearing the story while Nami notes that the Arlong situation was really eating Jinbe up inside. Sanji kicks at Luffy who fell asleep during the whole story as usual. Nami also speaks with Shirahoshi. claiming that her mother was an amazing woman which the princess also agrees with stating she feels comfortable around Nami even if they have just met. Nami states it's probably due to having a similar background (both having had their mothers murdered at an early age).

The talk then moves to Hody, with Hatchan stating that he is even worse when it came to hating humans. The difference between them being that while Arlong would not hurt his own kind, Hody has no such reservations especially if they feel compassion to humans. He also states a Levely that happens every four years is coming up and Neptune was to attend such. Jinbe question if Hody wishes to stop that, but Hatchan says there is much more to it. Before he can continue, Chopper spots a Den Den Mushi coming out of the forest. Den states it is a visual one hooked up to a monitor, Hody's image then comes on a nearby TV screen, and he begins to address the entire island.

#### The Three-Hour Ultimatum: An Unavoidable Showdown[]

All across the island, the citizens are being forced to step on the fumi-e of Queen Otohime much to their reluctance. Hody's broadcast soon begins and he starts by proclaiming that the Ryugu Kingdom has fallen and that he is the new king of the island. He orders that those who sympathize with humans are to leave the island and that he is allowing citizens from the Fish-Man District onto the island as well, much to the terror of the citizens.

Hody goes on about how humans are not to be trusted, mentioning Otohime's death to the anger of Fukaboshi, Manboshi and Ryuboshi and that the Ryugu Kingdom is leading them down the path of death. He then showcases King Neptune chained up, calling him weak and proclaims that he will kill the king in three hours, much to the horror of his children. Nami muses that it was their fault that it happened, when Jinbe protests Camie vouches for the Straw Hats claiming the Ammo Knights attacked them first. Hody Jones continues his speech and declares that he will behead King Neptune in three hours, at the plaza.

Hody then shows the box full of petitions for Levely, saying he could just tear it up. But he then changes his mind, deciding that the people whose names are on the petitions are traitors to the country and he will find and kill every one of them. Lastly, he calls out to Luffy, showing him Zoro, Usopp, and Brook in a cage in a room slowly filling with water, saying he will drown them after the king is executed. Then he will come for Luffy for stopping Arlong, showing his new bounty poster of 400,000,000 and proclaiming he will take his head before cutting the transmission. The citizens call him insane, but Fukaboshi claims he will stop him. Meanwhile, with the trapped Straw Hats, Usopp yells at Zoro do to something but Zoro sarcastically tells him to undo the locks. Brook jokes on how he scared the fish-men with the fact he was alive, but Usopp and Zoro complain if he continued playing dead, he could have saved them. Zoro muses that Nami got away so she will bring help, though Usopp complains what would happen if they did not come and does a convincing impression of Robin questioning Nami's fate which makes Brook laugh.

Meanwhile, in the Sea Forest's back woods, Robin managed to locate the Poneglyph, noticing that it is different from the others as it seems to be written more like an apology letter, involving someone named  Joy Boy. Back with Luffy's group, he shows his happiness at his bounty increase, which gets him slapped by Nami yelling that it is not the time. Jinbe figures that the increase was after the  Marineford War. Luffy starts to set off to go rescue his crew but is stopped by Jinbe. Shirahoshi starts to take off as well, but Jinbe stops her too. Hatchan is really against the idea of her going as he mentions that Hody knows about Shirahoshi's power to summon sea kings and is using the king as a hostage to shield against such an attack. If she were captured, Hody might try to use the power for himself. It was also the reason why he partnered with Vander Decken IX, to get her out of the way since Decken was already pursuing her. Shirahoshi tells them she does not know if she has such a power, although she has heard about it. Jinbe figures as long as Hody does not find out about her Shirahoshi not knowing about the ability, then they have a chance. Luffy once more decides to head out, ordering Sanji to look after Shirahoshi. Jinbe once more stops him, telling him he should not fight Hody. Franky and Chopper ask if it's because they are human, (Sanji calling them out on that) which Jinbe confirms, telling them some refugee still hold grudges against humans and asks them to leave it to him. Luffy counters that their friends' lives are on the line and that everyone will suffer if he does nothing. Luffy tells Jinbe he is free to try and stop him. Jinbe reluctantly complies to the challenge and the two prepare to fight.

Nami, Sanji, Chopper and Shirahoshi yell at the two to stop. Luffy uses this distraction to try and hop on Megalo to go to the palace, but Jinbe hits him with the  move: , knocking him away and managing to hurt him which Nami notices. Jinbe explains that  makes use of all surrounding water, including those in living organisms which allows him to attack anything even a rubberman such as Luffy. Luffy attacks back with a . Jinbe manages to block it asking if that all Luffy's training has produced. Before the fight can go any further, Robin suddenly appears in between the two trying to stop the fight. But Luffy and Jinbe are on the verge of hitting her causing Sanji to step in to save her. However, it's reveals it wasn't actually Robin, but a clone made from her powers and Sanji winds up in a cross-counter of Luffy and Jinbe's attacks, all three getting hit.

The real Robin shows herself and tells the three they are all friends after all. After everyone calms down, Jinbe tries to talk some sense into Luffy, explaining that every time they tried to get along with humans, humans would always reject them leading the fish-men to believe that all humans hate them. Even the Arlong incident made them think he was taken down just because he was a fish-man. So, if Luffy tries to battle Hody it will just be viewed as more human oppression to someone trying to end it. Sanji counters however that if they left now, Fish-Man Island would be under Hody's rule and as they have friends on the island, they cannot just turn a blind eye. Sanji also asks Hatchan that when he pleaded for them to leave, it was because Hody attacked him for sympathizing with humans which Hatchan is reluctant to answer. Sanji concludes that it's because it's their country that Luffy does have more of a reason to fight other than just saving his crew. Luffy demands at Jinbe to get out of the way once more which the fish-man refuses, forcing Luffy to declare he will have to beat Jinbe to move on.

Back in Ryugu Palace, one of Hody's crew ask who they will guard the palace. Hody declares no one since he figures no one can break into the palace. The gaping slash across his entire chest cavity from Zoro still affects him and he asks for an energy steroid to ease the pain before asking about the residents from the Fish-Man District which one of his crew confirm their moving into main parts of the island. Hody tells them to also use the homes of those who will leave or die as well, stating that will be a great nation that will despise humans. In the Candy District, one of the New Fish-Man Pirates officers, Daruma is using his jaws to chew up the factory. Largely in anger for being given cappuccino and sweets for snacks instead of meat and reminds the citizens he will eat them if they make that mistake again. He then heads  Gyoncorde Plaza, leaving the citizens be as they know what will happen if they oppose them. Once he leaves via biting underground, the citizens state that the Ryugu Princes are their only hope.

Back at the palace and the captive Straw Hats, Brook reveals a new power to leave his body as a soul which he admits he stumbled onto while praying one day. Usopp tells him to go get Pappag to get the keys to free them since Pappag seems to have been left behind. But Zoro tells him to just bring him one of his swords and he will cut the locks and the cages. Brook goes to do so and manages to find Pappag but his appearance scares the starfish who runs away from him.

Meanwhile, in the West of the island in Waterwheel Town, Dosun was beaten and tied up along with his unit with the residents of the area looking after them. One of them suggest using Dosun as a hostage to prevent Hody from attacking but Dosun counters that Hody will just view them as weak and have them killed. Continuing that he always been that way, hating fish-men who interacted with human pirates or those who were given blood by humans as he feels the blood of humans are tainted and that anyone who stood in their way was an enemy to them. In the midst of the speech, one of the New Fish-Man Pirates manage to shoot an Energy Steroid into Dosun's mouth and he gradually recovers till he breaks free of his chains. He then attacks the residents, vowing revenge on Fukaboshi before telling his men they're heading for Gyoncorde Plaza.

On the south of the island before the Fish-Man's Meeting Hall, Hyouzou has gotten himself drunk which his crew is trying to snap him out of for the upcoming battle against the Neptune Army. However, another fish-man rushes in yelling at the others to get away from him, warning that Hyouzou is known as the alcoholic assassin. But it's too late as Hyouzou slashes at a few of them thinking they're the Neptune army. In the east of the island in the Marine Shopping Hall, Zeo is attacking a few of the citizens while making himself invisible mocking them all the while. A few of the fish-man pirates suddenly attack what they think is a bug, but it turns out to be Zeo himself who reappears after the beating. Despite this, he continues on how the Ryugu rule will fall with the death of King Neptune and that it is time to head to Gyoncorde Plaza. Astonishing his unit as they refer to him as the "Noble of the Fish-Man District."

Northwest from Waterwheel Town and headed to said plaza, we find the Ryugu brothers on one of their ships with still an hour before they reach it. The guards wonder why Hody is doing the execution at the plaza rather than the palace, figuring it to be a trap. Fukaboshi knows as much but does not care as they have to save their father. Manboshi and Ryuboshi brings up some other points such as the pirates that have stopped coming to the island thinking it to be Hody's doing. The welfare of their sister since Hody did not mention her during his announcement. And the Straw Hats which, despite Shyarly's prediction, they question sensing that they are not bad people especially since the mermaids were fond of them, who are known to be great judges of character, seeing through malicious facades. Ryuboshi agrees but puts the topic on hold to focus on the upcoming battle and calls all of the country's troops to arms. In Gyoverly Hills, a few of the Ammo Knights along with the Ministers are battling a Sea Bear Sea King but are faring poorly. The New Fish-Man Pirates try to stop it from continuing further but cannot control it. One of the fish-men suggest using fire to calm it down, they do so, and it starts to work but the officer with them, Ikaros Much, suddenly becomes affected too, uncontrollably bending over backwards.

He yells for the fire to be put out, stating he dries out like a squid when near one. They do so and Ikaros scolds the group further. A few of the fish-men pirates say that he had a friend named  Daidalos once who was a squid. But Daidalos swam too close to the sun's rays and became a dried roasted squid. Ever since Ikaros instinctively starts becoming a dried squid whenever he sees fire due to trauma. Ikaros suddenly fires on a squid spear from his hand which hits one of the fish-men and sucks all the water out of them. Ikaros then start pounding said fish-man with his palms as punishment for the fire till one of his crew shouts, they have to get to the plaza. Before they can, one of the guards point to something in the sky, revealing it to be Hody on a Giraffe Sea King with the tied-up Neptune heading for the plaza. The citizens call out to Neptune, begging him to save them. But Neptune feels he cannot since he cannot protect his own people. The Minister of the Right also worries about this since if they cannot protect their king, they cannot call themselves an army.

Ikaros asks where Hody is which Neptune states that it's because of the Energy Steroid they are using. The fish-men pirates elaborate further that because of what happened when he faced Zoro, Hody been taking Energy Steroids back-to-back to ease the pain. But it now affecting him and tearing his body apart. Hody suddenly yells out in pain much to his crew's shock and worry. The Sea Bear with them suddenly starts acting strangely, a look of horror coming over its face as if sensing something different about Hody. Cut back to Vander Decken whose brooding over her rejection from Princess Shirahoshi, even shaving his hair. After which he ponders what to do about Luffy now protecting her. He hits upon an idea that instantly cheers him up. At Gyoverly Hills, the Ministers and the Ammo Knights have been defeated. The Minister to the Left utters to himself how they were so close to attending the Levely and achieving Queen Otohime's dream before this all happened. He prays to the gods for a miracle to stop Hody.

Meanwhile, in the Gyoncorde Plaza, Neptune has been set up at the site where Otohime was assassinated. His crew had taken over the area with the sea kings surrounding it. Hody meanwhile has undergone a drastic change due to the Energy Steroids, he became much bulkier, taller and his hair has gone white. In front of the group lay the Ammo Knights completely defeated. One of the guards gets to his feet and pulls out some dynamite, citing if he can at least take out one of the leaders he would have done his job before the princes arrive. But just as he prepares to light it, Hody hits him with a water shot. The shot knocks down the guard and continues to sail through the island, shooting through a few buildings before finally landing in the waters at Mermaid Cove. The pirates marvel at Hody new strength who comments he feels incredible.

In that moment, the princes' barge into the plaza and charge at the group. Ryuboshi shouts at them that the people of the island were ready to look beyond their oppression and accept relations with the humans. He also comments on the pirate's obsession with hatred and revenge before vowing that he will not let them hurt the people of the kingdom. The Sea Kings are set after the three princes, but they easily defeat all of them much to the astonishment of the citizens and the pirates. The princes declare they have a chance now and if Hody were to win they would never get another one. Hody counters that despite what they say in the end, the kingdom will belong to the victor. Hody's crew and the princes then charge at each other for battle.

We then go to Jinbe and Shirahoshi who are on Megalo headed for the plaza, the princess worries for her father, but Jinbe assures her they will think of something. All across the island, citizens hurry to the plaza. Jinbe and Shirahoshi are also on their way there when the princess spots what she thinks is Neptune when really, it's a batch of balloons shaped liked him with the sound of his voice playing from it.

Back at the plaza, it is revealed that the princes were beaten by the pirates and are now tied up alongside Neptune. They apologize to their father who reassures them that it is not their fault since the pirates' dependence on the energy steroids is only granting them false strength. Hody's crew call for their immediate execution, but Hody refuses as he does not know the status of Shirahoshi. Manboshi yells at him to leave her alone since she does not have anything to do with him, but Hody rebuffs that and says he knew her secret all along. One of the pirates call out to Hody who reveals they captured Jinbe and Shirahoshi who had fallen for the fake Neptune trap. With all his captives now in place, Hody laughs to himself that the only thing left is the Straw Hats who he figures have gone to the palace to rescue their friends. And even if they get to the plaza, he made preparations for them. Out come 100,000 outlaws (70,000 fish-men and 30,000 captive humans) who surround the plaza ready to fight.

However, Madame Shyarly suddenly appears and calls out Hody, telling him not to get cocky as she had a vision of someone destroying Fish-Man Island. Hody figures it to be himself, but she stands by her the prediction that she made earlier and states it is Luffy who will do it, which will make Hody's takeover of the kingdom worthless. Hody gets mad at this news and hits Shyarly with a water shot, asking if it was revenge for her brother, Arlong, since he was the big name around the Fish-Man District and now he has taken the mantle. He then goes on to gloat about how he put the plan into action... by first killing Queen Otohime. As everyone reels in shock at the news, he continues stating that he paid a human to burn the names for Levely, then shot her and used the human as a scapegoat for the murder as well as to demoralize the island. Hody continues to bad mouth Otohime claiming that her crying over the island was reason enough to kill her and proudly declaring doing the deed. However, Shirahoshi reveals that she had always known Hody was the killer much to Neptune's and Jinbe's shock.

Meanwhile in the Fish-Man District, Vander Decken IX uses his powers to move the ark, Noah, which he wishes to use to not only kill Shirahoshi but to destroy the entire island as well as a sendoff his "beloved."

Hody questions Shirahoshi on what she means that she always knew. Shirahoshi explains that Megalo told her having seen Hody actually fire the shot that killed Otohime. The princes then ask why she never told them which the princess reveals it was her mother's dying wish for her not to hate Otohime's killer. Shirahoshi never told the princes as she did not want them holding a grudge either. Jinbe understands her plight and sympathizes with her, but Hody just laughs at her. Mocking her and Megalo that not telling the princes has allowed Hody to continue with his plans unhindered. Hody then hits Neptune and the princes with water shots gravely wounding them to the horror of the citizens of the island. A few of the fish-man kids go to Madame Shyarly and ask her when Luffy will destroy the island. She answers she can only see into the future not pinpoint the date, so she has no idea when. The kids state that while the destruction of the island will be bad for them, it will be bad for Hody's troops too. A grown-up fish-man agrees with them and begs Luffy to come destroy the island to save the royal family. Others soon join in with the plea as well.

Hody however remains in denial of Shyarly's claims, calling them lies (disregarding their well-known accuracy and his knowledge of the Straw Hats' strength) before going to finish off Neptune. Just as he about to do the killing strike, Shirahoshi calls out to Luffy herself. On that cue, something comes out of Megalo's mouth and rushes straight for Hody kicking him in the stomach and sending him flying into a wall. The figure of course is Luffy in , much to the shock of the citizens that he answered their call. The citizens all cheer while the New Fish-Man Pirates are dumbfounded that he was there the whole time. Jinbe tells someone they need to hurry which as it turns out to be Nami having used her  to hide herself as well as grab the keys for the locks of Neptune and the princes' cuffs. Plus, the paper signed by the Celestial Dragons. Something is soon spotted in the sky revealing it to be Franky on the Sunny and Hoe. Franky fires his  at the pirates sending them flying. With the way clear, Hoe flies in and picks up Neptune and the Prince while the Sunny crashes into the plaza.

Upon seeing Luffy, a few of the citizens all call out if Luffy and his crew are friends or foe which he answers simply they will have to decide for themselves.

#### Battle for Fish-Man Island: Straw Hat Pirates and Jinbe vs. New Fish-Man Pirates[]

A flashback to a few hours earlier shows that in the Sea Forest when Luffy and Jinbe were arguing. Jinbe tells Luffy that he does not want Luffy to face Hody as just another savage human but rather as the hero of the island. Luffy initially refuses cause his crew and he are pirates, using an example of sharing meat to make his point. When Jinbe mentions he will feed him if they help however, Luffy instantly agrees. Jinbe goes over the plan of allowing himself to get caught and sneaking Luffy's group in close enough to grab the keys and the Celestial Dragon's letter which he hopes will get the citizens on their side. Though he tells the group to figure something out in rescuing their friends from Ryugu Palace. Luffy reaffirms he is just doing this because Jinbe asked him too, but it is obviously just a tough front of his and that he would have done it anyway.

Back in the current time, Hody recovers himself from Luffy's attack while the citizens cheer on the Straw Hats. Zeo tries to tell the Straw Hats not to get carried away, but they ignore him, Zoro's group discounting Sanji's claims of rescuing them to the others explaining that they broke themselves out and grabbed Hoe on the way to the plaza. Nami gives Shirahoshi the Celestial Dragon's letter while Luffy acknowledges that she is not such a weakling as he made her out to be. Jinbe concurs, encouraging her to continue on to end the prejudice between the humans and the fish-men and declaring that he will protect her. Hody comes back into the area, complaining that Vander Decken failed in erasing Shirahoshi and falling for Jinbe's trap. Hody continues on, calling Jinbe a fool for siding with the humans while Fisher Tiger and Arlong were defeated by them. He also states his plan of going to the Levely and killing the kings there to make a terrifying name for himself and Fish-Man Island across the globe. Dragging humans into the ocean and making them his slaves, Hody even state that he will become the Pirate King that way which strikes a nerve with Luffy. Hody then mocks the Straw Hats as they are 10 to his 100,000 before setting his pirates on the group.

Luffy goes forward as Zoro and Sanji look on unimpressed. Nami, Usopp, Chopper and Pappag in the Soldier Dock system unaware of what's happening though Franky tell them it's not time yet. Just as the pirates are about to attack Luffy, he unleashes his Haoshoku Haki; dropping 50,000 of the pirates in an instant much to the shock of everyone there, including the Straw Hats. Luffy calls out to Hody, telling him that while he does not care what kind of king Hody wants to be, there is only room for one Pirate King. Luffy then charges forward, goes into  and attacks the pirates yelling he will take them all on. Jinbe and the rest of the Straw Hats follow his lead and prepare for battle.

Zeo tries to rally his troops while Zoro and Sanji complain of Luffy taking out much of their opponents and arguing amongst themselves. Hody tries to fire a water shot at the princess but is stopped by another water shot created by Jinbe who comments that Hody's  is still no match for his. The pirates comment that Jinbe was the first fish-man to be a Warlord of the Sea and that his bounty rose to over 400,000,000 after he left. Jinbe challenges the pirates to fight him if they want to take Shirahoshi. A few pirates aim cannons at Shirahoshi but Brook steps in and uses his music to hypnotize the pirates and make them fire their shots into the air before striking them down with his swordplay. A few pirates charge at Zoro while defending themselves with shields. But he unleashes a new  technique called  that forms into a whirlwind, cutting up the shields and continue to chase the pirates afterward. While the pirates run away and scream, they ask when it will stop following them to which Zoro replies it will chase them to hell.

A few of the sea urchin pirates uses their bubbles to fly overheard and aim for Shirahoshi and Sanji, intending to skewer them with their spikes. Sanji just stands there reminiscing when he was chased by the okama on  Momoiro Island, citing he ran and ran till he ran out of places to run to. Just as the urchins close in, they find he has disappeared or rather jumped into the air using  having learned it on Momoiro citing that he "had to learn to fly" to get away from his pursuers. He tells the attackers he is Shirahoshi's knight before hitting them with a new  attack called , rapidly knocking out the urchin squad. Robin meanwhile makes two giant legs from her power and stomps a few of the pirates flat. A group of the pirates called the Hyper Toxin Squadron are called in, looking to poison their opponents. That is until Franky revels the 4th Soldier Dock system:  Black Rhino FR-U IV, a motorcycle with spiked wheels and a rhino design on the front. Franky easily plows through them before coming upon a pirate wielding a mace. Before the pirate can strike, he is blown aside by the 5th Soldier Dock weapon:  Brachio Tank V, a mini tank driven by Usopp, Chopper, Nami and Pappag. Both of these weapons instantly get Luffy praise though Zoro yells they are still in a fight.

The fish-men citizens are amazed the group is fending off Hody's forces despite having been outnumbered and cheer them on. Irritated by this, Hody calls out Surume to take care of them. Mentioning that he hauled the Kraken from the North Pole and made it his slave. The fish-men citizens believe they could never win against the Kraken, but Luffy however calls out to Surume and ask to ride on top of him since they are friends. Surume agrees with Luffy and offers his aid, smashing happily through the rest of the pirates who call out for their captain to help them. Hody looks on in anger at this new turn of events.

Luffy tells Surume to protect the princess while the pirates look on in disbelief that the kraken sided with Luffy. Chopper notices that most of the pirates have avoided them which Usopp decides to take advantage of to attack their captain. However, they suddenly wind up falling into a pitfall made by Daruma who used his teeth to burrow underground to stop their machines. Daruma sets out to do the same to Franky, but the cyborg ends up accidentally driving his motorcycle into the same one the tank fell into. Angered at this, Franky tosses Usopp, Nami, Chopper and Pappag out of the hole.

When asked why, Franky reveals that he is going to "transform" and that it's a one-person vehicle. He merges the  and the  to combine and create the  Iron Pirate: General Franky: A giant mecha bearing his likeness. Franky claims he used the genius Vegapunk's unfinished prototype designs and completed them through the application of  Wapometal. The pirates are dumbstruck at this new creation, while Luffy, Usopp and Chopper are awed at the docking mecha. Nami and Robin remain indifferent. Regardless, Franky goes on the attack, first using the mech's sword to swing at the pirates' feet. When they jump, he comments he can hit them with cannons from his shoulder. Luffy thinks this to mean he will shoot them with the mecha's cannons but in reality, it's just Franky popping out of the cockpit and firing his own shoulder cannons before flattening the pirates with the mecha's weight.

As Nami watches this, one of the pirates tries to sneak up on her. She blocks with her new staff and unveils a new  Clima-Tact weapon when she fires a blast of gust from it, knocking the pirate out. A few of the fish-men pirates charge Usopp who uses his Pop Greens to make bamboo shoot up from underneath them, Usopp owing it to his training with  Heracles. The citizens continue to look on in awe as the Straw Hats fight, commenting that it looks like they wanted to fight so much they could not help themselves. Daruma burrows underground, hoping to make more pitfalls to stop the Straw Hats but is intercepted and knocked out of the ground by Chopper who showcases a new point form; , where he keeps his humanoid body but gains two large horns which he used to burrow after Daruma. When Luffy asks if he became a stag beetle, Chopper shouts he is not and that he refined his point forms that he now only needs the rumble ball for one transformation. He can now freely transform into his other six form whenever he wishes.

Hody ask how many of the Straw Hats they have taken down, which turns out to be zero. Hody calls out to Surume, "congratulating" him on capturing Shirahoshi before threatening the Kraken that he could go up North where his brothers are and kill them if he continues to disobey. Upon hearing this, Surume starts to squeeze Shirahoshi but Luffy overhears this as well and asks Surume if that is the reason, he was answering to Hody. Visibly understanding his plight, Luffy tells Surume that he will protect them too which Surume starts to hesitate upon hearing. With that, Luffy starts to head for Hody. Ikaros Much and Dosun go to intercept him but are knocked aside by Zoro and Sanji. Hody orders his pirates to stop Luffy, but Luffy disappears from their sight and reappears in front of Hody, kicking him in the face with a furious expression.

Meanwhile, Neptune and the princes, who are in a clearing, spot the Noah ship moving on its own. Fukaboshi ask Neptune why he is getting upset over seeing it move which Neptune answers that it cannot be moved until "The Day That Must Come."

#### Noah on Collision Course: The End of the Alliance and the Separate Battles[]

Back at the plaza, the pirates are showing their worry for their captain. But Hody gets back up from the attack he received from Luffy and tries to take his head off with . It only succeeds in knocking Luffy's head back thanks to his rubber body. Luffy coats his forehead with Armament Haki just as a few fish-man try to shield Hody with . But Luffy hits them with his  attack which, thanks to the Armament, knocks them out. Hody tries to rush in and kick Luffy, but Luffy uses the Armament on his arm and blocks the attack, injuring Hody's leg. Luffy then flips and hits Hody with his Axe attack coated with the Armament as well, smashing him into the ground. Hody gets back up and rapidly fires water shots at Luffy. But the Straw Hat dodges them easily much to the astonishment of the pirates. Luffy then hits Hody with an Armament-powered  attack sending him flying into a wall.

Shirahoshi and the citizens all marvel at Luffy's strength. Before the fight can go any further however, the sky suddenly grows dark. Everyone looks up to see the Noah ship heading straight for the plaza threatening to break the bubble around the island, killing both its fish-man and human inhabitants. Both sides begin to panic with as the huge ship about to smash into them until something suddenly falls from the ship revealing itself to be Wadatsumi who slipped off the ship and into the plaza. He begs Decken to stop the ship so he will not get crushed. Meanwhile, The New Fish-Man Pirates ask Hody if this was part of his plan though he just tells them to shut up as he gets back to his feet. Luffy remarks how tough the fish-man captain is, having withstood a Color of Armaments attack. Hody yells to Decken that crashing the ship into the island was not part of their agenda. But Decken, via a Den Den Mushi, explains his intent to murder Shirahoshi even if it means sacrificing his underlings and allies. Jinbe realizes that Decken "threw" the ship at Shirahoshi as he had done before with letters and weapons. But before he can go on, he realizes Shirahoshi has disappeared.

The princess turns out to be right in front of Noah, begging Decken to spare her people's lives in exchange for her own. The ship turns away from the plaza toward her while Decken throws a knife at her, hitting Shirahoshi in the arm. As all this goes on Hody realizes that Decken betrayed him. He jumps to one of the chains on the underside of Noah, growling about Decken but citing it's a good situation. Sanji starts to head towards Noah, but Luffy yells out that he is going alone and for the SH to look after the plaza. He asks Jinbe if there is water in the ship which Jinbe states there might be but as Decken is a Devil Fruit user, there might be air as well. Jinbe throws Luffy a bubble making coral before Luffy stretches his arms to Sanji's leg and yells for him to fling him to Noah.

The citizens of the island all cry out for Shirahoshi as she diverts Noah, preventing it from ramming into the island's bubble but the danger of it damaging it still remains. Seeing as she is too far away from the entrance to reach the ocean, Shirahoshi instead heads for the palace entrance since it's now deserted. Hody continues to cling on the chain on the underside of the ship. Sanji prepares to fling Luffy to the ship, reminding him to watch out for Hody and the fish-man underwater capabilities. Calculating on balancing out his power so he does not overshoot Luffy into the ocean, Sanji preforms his  move shooting Luffy towards Noah. Luffy manages to make it out of the island's bubble and onto one of the ship's chains which is currently in the space between the ocean and the island's bubble. Luffy notices that Hody is below him on a chain that still within the island's bubble. The citizens all grab one of the ship's chains and pull hoping to slow the ship down and give Shirahoshi time to escape. However, Hody sees this and mocks their attempts as weakness, citing its why fish-man are looked down upon. He hits the citizens with his  much to Luffy's anger.

Shirahoshi manages to make it to the corridor connecting to the place which is out in the ocean. Noah follows after her which in turn drags Luffy into the ocean. He quickly uses the bubble coral to make a bubble around him but in doing so, lets go of the chain he was riding which causes him to flow out into the ocean. If that was not bad enough, Hody finds and prepares to attack him. Meanwhile, Decken continues chasing Shirahoshi, yelling that either the ship will get her, or she will die from her wounds. He gives her one last chance to marry him citing he will call off the attack if she agrees to his demands. Shirahoshi refuses however, just as Decken throws more knives at her. Before they can hit, they are blocked by Manboshi and Fukaboshi who are riding Hoe. The brothers tell Decken they will not let him have their sister. They also comment that Neptune told them about the importance of the ship, so they wish to prevent any damage to it. At first, they try to get it onto the ocean's floor. But the ship begins to slam into some underwater rocks. Seeing as it's too dangerous to land the ship on the floor they swim upward.

Meanwhile, Fukaboshi has managed to save Luffy from Hody's wraith despite his wounds. Hody however, uncovers a blade fin called Kirisame and puts it on his back. He darts after the two and they barely manage to dodge him, seeing Hody cut up a rock and a fish that was swimming by it. Luffy orders Fukaboshi to get him to the deck of the ship so he can fight easier as he wishes to keep his promise of protecting Shirahoshi. Hearing this, Fukaboshi remembers his promise he made with his mother to do the same. He tells Luffy this as well as apologizes for doubting him. Hody, overhearing this however, swims to the deck of the ship. He lands on Noah as Decken greets him, asking if he has killed Neptune and that he is using the ship to torment Shirahoshi, asking if it was a good plan. Hody responds by stabbing Decken with his trident, then ask Decken what would happen to the ship if he were to die.

Hody pulls his trident out of Decken and then reveals he touched Hody with his left hand at the last minute and throws an axe at him. Hody tells Decken he betrayed him first, but destroying the island was a great idea. After a little argument, Decken gets offensive. He then lashes out with a kick, revealing blades hidden in his shoes. Hody catches the leg with his teeth and bites down on it. He then swings Decken around and uses him as a shield to intercept the axe thrown earlier. Hody laughs and says he has to kill Shirahoshi before the ship crashes. He somersaults past the two younger brothers, cutting them with the blade on his back in the process. Ryuboshi tells his sister to run. Hody grabs her hair and stops her, saying even a mermaid cannot beat his speed. Luffy then attacks him with , hitting him in the chest. Hody tells Luffy he has no chance of winning a fight in the deep sea, saying he cannot protect anything. Luffy says he spent the last two years training to do just that.

Back at Gyoncorde Plaza, Wadatsumi has lost the will to fight, crying that his captain abandoned him. Zeo makes up a lie and tells him that he did not hear Decken's orders to take care of the plaza for him. Zeo throws him an Energy Steroid and Wadatsumi starts his rampage, brutally beating Surume. He then sets his sights on Jinbe. Jinbe blocks his fist with , stopping the attack with his foot and hurting Wadatsumi's hand in the process. As Wadatsumi falls, everyone around him is blown away as he falls, including Nami. This angers Sanji and he kicks Wadatsumi in the head knocking him back up on his feet, confusing him as to who is attacking him now. Sanji tells him he will pay for hurting Nami. The matchup reads . Elsewhere in the plaza, Hyouzou is on a rampage, his appearance having changed after eating too many Energy Steroids, just like Hody's did. He takes down several people with . Hyouzou then sets his sights on Robin and charges at her. Zoro swoops in and blocks the attack, saying he will be taking on Hyouzou, calling him a good warmup for the New World. The match up reads .

As all this goes on, Nami battles a few fish-man pirates who notice her attacks coming from her rod and think her as a witch. She corrects that she is more of a magician and her attack are just basic weather chemistry before attacking them with a move called , streaming black clouds and whipping it at her opponents, shocking them. Ikaros Much is nearly caught in the radius triggering his "dried squid" reflex. Zeo and he surmise that Nami is the Straw Hats' weakness from Sanji's reaction and go to attack her. Zeo camouflaging himself and holding down her legs while Ikaros goes to stab her with his squid spears. Brook, seeing this, moves in and takes the attack (while also asking to see Nami's panties again earning him a punch to the face from her). Ikaros cites his spear will dry up all of Brook's moisture but as he is a skeleton and already all dried up, it does not work.

As Ikaros is reeling in shock from this, Franky, looking for an opponent to test his mecha on, blindsides Ikaros with a punch. Ikaros gets back up and the two prepare to fight. Meanwhile, the Fish-Man Pirates yell at Brook to get off Zeo whom unknowingly is stepped on his due to Zeo's camouflage. Zeo makes an excuse that he was "headbutting" Brook's foot to save face. Brook lets him up and they proceed to battle. Over with Chopper whose playing cat and mouse with Daruma underground which is causing the fish-men pirates to fall through the newly made holes. Above ground, Dosun spots Usopp whom yells for Chopper to come to him. Dosun prepares to attack the sniper, but Chopper smells his scent and calls for Usopp to duck before busting from the ground and right into Dosun. Usopp compliments Chopper before firing an exploding Pop Green at Daruma, blowing up him and his fellow fish-man pirates. Usopp mentions they fought someone before that could dig holes (referring to  Miss Merry Christmas) so they have experience in this sort of thing. Daruma and Dosun recover and go on to take on Usopp and Chopper respectively.

The pirates are surprised that, despite their numbers, the Straw Hats are holding their own against their commanders. The fish-man citizens help with the wounded during this while some kids mention their worry for the princess and ask Shyarly if the island will really be destroyed. She does not answer and looks up into the sky, uncertain. Meanwhile, above the island, Hody mocks Luffy on his wish to protect everything. Fukaboshi and Manboshi realize that if something were to happen with Decken the ship would fall on the island. Fukaboshi yells for Shirahoshi to change her course to the side but Hody attacks once more, telling them to not interfere. Luffy realizes what is happening and tells Ryuboshi to take him to Shirahoshi but Hody gets in their way. However, Shirahoshi heard her brother and started swimming to the side, directing the ship away from the island. Hody starts to go after her, but Luffy stretches to grab him. However, the water saps away his strength allowing Hody to break free. Ryuboshi comments that if Decken is still conscious, his power is still in effect. Inside Noah, Decken is revealed to indeed still be alive and swears vengeance upon Hody. However, the turning of the ship causes him to fall over and bump his head against a rock, knocking him out. Due to this, his power fades and the ship begins to fall toward the island. Hody begins to celebrate while Luffy and the princes look on in horror.

As the ship starts to fall toward the island, Fukaboshi with Luffy on his back, races to it. Yelling of the Noah's purpose and promising Neptune along with his brothers that they would protect it. Hody mocks the two on if they could protect the island, Luffy redeclares his will by smashing the ship but Fukaboshi yells out not to if there is a chance to save it. Luffy then ask how as he cannot think of any other way. Shirahoshi starts to rush to the ship herself yelling for Decken to revive. Hody goes to attack her, but Manboshi gets in the way of the attack and takes the hit. Luffy stretches to Hody and grabs him. Just as he about to hit him, Hody bites in his shoulder. Regardless, Luffy manages to knock Hody aside and pull off the fangs but complains his Armament Haki is not strong enough to withstand blows like that. Hody recover and states he knows of Luffy intention of trying to fight him on the Noah. He uses his fin sword to slash the bubbles around the ship, letting the air seep out as result.

As Hody once more mocks Luffy, Fukaboshi charges in and starts attacking him, asking Hody if he knows the consequences of what he is doing and asking how he could sacrifice the lives of his fellow fish-man for revenge. Ultimately, asking what caused Hody to do all these things. Hody answers which apparently shocks everyone in the area. He then stabs Fukaboshi much to the horror as Shirahoshi. Luffy suddenly gets a call from a portable Den Den Mushi on him from a person he met in the air tank. We flash back a bit to when Hody was heading for the deck of the ship. Rather than go after him, Fukaboshi heads to the main entrance of the island, ordering a few of the Ammo Knights to ready the air tank for an air blast. Luffy and he then headed for Decken, Luffy telling him that there is air on the ship. But Fukaboshi knows Hody would more than likely target the bubble around the ship and handed Luffy the Den Den Mushi.

In the present time, Luffy asks the guards what they plan to do. They respond that they are going to envelop the falling ship with air bubble as it passes. However, it will not stop the ship from falling. Luffy understands and tells them to do it. Hody attacks again, asking what they can do. Luffy responds by catching him, breaking his fin blade, equipping Armament Haki on his arm and punching him back. Hody recovers, yelling he will do whatever it takes to have his revenge on humans. The Ammo Knights ready to shoot the air bubble over to Noah while Luffy receives a call from Fukaboshi who tells Luffy he knows the true character of Hody.

The story then goes back a few minutes in the sea forest where Camie, Hatchan and Den are. Den notices that the fish are leaving the forest, a sign that indicates somethings happening. Hatchan hates that he cannot join the fight and figures the Straw Hat and Jinbe will win. But knows that Hody will not give up so easily. When Camie asks what he is talking about, Hatchan states that Fisher was afraid something like this would happen. Meanwhile, all around Fish-Man Island, the order for the evacuation is given from the Minister of the Left, revealing what Decken and Hody have planned. The citizens all debate what to do, especially upon hearing that Shirahoshi was risking her life to save them. Meanwhile, the Minister of the Left along with some guards manage to find Neptune and apologize for not being strong enough. He tells them it's alright and asks if they have seen Noah. They confirm it and Neptune comments that if it hits the Princess or the Island it will be over as was written. The Minister of the Left suggests Neptune evacuate with the citizens. But he refuses as he wishes to wait for his children.

Meanwhile, the Minister of the Right has recovered and reaches the plaza where the battle between the Straw Hats plus Jinbe and the New Fish-Man Pirates continue. He has brought up to speed on what's going on (and is thoroughly taken aback upon hearing of the Straw Hats feats of strength) and orders his guards to help restrain Wadatsumi which will leave them with just the pirates to deal with. Stating they would lose face if they did nothing to help the pirates who willingly took the blame for their false accusations. He also orders the citizens to evacuate but they refuse as they do not want to leave behind the people who were helping them, stating they are putting their fate in the Straw Hats. The Minister to the Right understands and tells them to do what they feel is right before rushing off to join the fight. The pirates spot the Ammo Knights and rush to fight them. Among which is Hammond whose being carried by the human slaves in what he calls the "Slave Tank." One of the slaves drops from exhaustion, Hammond just tells him to drag him along and replace him. Robin takes note of this and comments on the cruelty of it.

Meanwhile, Wadatsumi suddenly puffs himself up making himself seem bigger. Sanji, who's on his cheek, is not impressed. What more Wadatsumi's new size is hitting his own allies. When Sanji tells him Surume is still bigger than him, Wadatsumi puffs himself up even bigger, but Sanji still keeps to his claim. As that goes on, on the ground Jinbe asks Robin to help free the human slaves. Robin asks if that is wise as the humans might have a grudge against the fish-men if she does. Jinbe answers that he will deal with any people with that mindset but at the moment, they are still humans plus he hates seeing the Fish-Man Pirates acting as if they are Celestial Dragons. Robin understands and agrees to his wishes. Over to the Franky and Ikaros Much fight, Ikaros fires spit at his mecha. It does not do anything and Franky punches at him, but it turns out to be a clone made of ink. Ikaros gets behind him but before he can counter, Franky fires a fireball at him, triggering his squid reflex. Chopper is amazed at the new weapon, but it turns out to be Franky doing it by opening the cockpit and firing it from his mouth as usual.

Dosun takes the opportunity to attack with his hammer, but Chopper goes  and stops it with a punch (though it hurts his hand a little). Zoro comments on Chopper's new  stating it looks more like a monster than human. Chopper states that before he wanted to be human to have friends. Now he wishes to be a monster to help Luffy. Hyouzou suddenly rushes to attack Zoro, but Zoro easily counters him stating he gave him a chance to escape his reach. Zoro then cuts two of the blades Hyouzou is holding, telling him to bring the best swordsman in Fish-Man Island as Hyouzou is not even worth killing time with.

As the battles continue to wage all around the plaza. Robin manages to secure the keys to the slaves of the Fish-Man Pirates and frees them from their shackles. No sooner than they are freed, the slaves carrying Hammond throw him to the ground. One of the slaves ask Robin why she freed them to which she answers to thank Jinbe who requested it of her. Hammond, however, fires a net at Robin from behind, but it turns out to be another of her clones. She spouts a clone on Hammond's back then grabs his legs with multiple hands and performs a double clutch move, breaking his back. The slaves, meanwhile, went to get their revenge on their captors and join the battle.

Meanwhile, Brook has lost sight of Zeo who has gone back into camouflage mode. However, Zeo gives himself away when he shouts the name of his technique and Brook stabs the area where he heard it. Zeo reveals himself and as usual, claims it was part of an attack of his when it clear that Brook really stabbed him. He then attacks Brook with his chain, managing to wrap it around Brook's head and pull it off.

Brook starts to reflect on how over the two years he discovered the true power of the  Yomi Yomi no Mi in that it emitted a powerful energy which he can distribute via playing music. When his soul leaves his body that is the form of such ectoplasmic energy. Said energy reconnects his head to his body as Zeo starts to celebrate beating one of the Straw Hats. Brook, however, revives calling the energy Tamashii much to Zeo's shock, who promptly tries to hide it. Brook explains that as long as his bones are intact, Zeo's attacks will not go to the core. He then unveils his sword which was sharpened by the  Longarm Tribe which he names , firing an attack at Zeo who exclaims its cold. Brook proclaims he will show him the chill of the underworld.

Over with Usopp who's watching the others fight, citing that he cannot lose as everyone has what they need to head to the New World. Daruma rushes at him while also setting himself on fire. Usopp manages to dodge and retaliate but Daruma jumps out of the way. He mocks Usopp, calling him a burden to the others but Usopp declares he has finished laying out his trap and he will beat Daruma in three moves. Daruma does not believe him, citing he should stop dreaming and give up. Usopp admits that he has deteriorated a bit, he does not lie as much as used to because now he can back up his claims.

As the battles rage on, the border security calls the Minister to the Left and informs him of what's happening outside the island. The Minster to the Left orders them to call for an evacuation of the island which the Border Patrol do via the intercom, telling everyone of the incoming danger including the Straw Hats and the Fish-Man Pirates. As everyone starts to evacuate, the signal gets mixed up with the conversation between Luffy and those in the air tank. While garbled the message is heard throughout the island followed shortly by the one with Fukaboshi. The rest of the conversation is heard as Fukaboshi explains that Hody and his crew are fish-men who thrive on the grudge of their forefathers and will use any justification for their crusade, refusing the quest for peace the island has worked for. The story flashes back to when Fukaboshi asked Hody what have the humans done to make him turn out the way he has. Hody simply answers "nothing," that he and his crew will bring down judgement on the humans and that he believes he and his crew were chosen by heaven to do so. The story goes back to the present as Fukaboshi finishes, stating that Hody and his crew are nothing but enemies with an empty will and ambition.

The story flashes back to Hody's childhood and shows how he and his crew were raised purely on the ideals of hatred in the Fish-Man District. Sermons, mostly from Arlong, would fill his head on how humans were the inferior species and how they had "driven" fish-man into the sea for their "superior" strength. Plus, how they were "chosen" by the heavens to "rain down punishment" on the humans. When Hatchan was telling some of his friends about Rayleigh, Hody refused to listen citing "it wanted to make him throw up." Years past and the news of Fisher Tiger's death reached their ears making them wonder if Tiger was not supposed to be the "chosen one" as they thought. At one point they had heard a fish-man had saved a human by giving him blood and, donning black masks, burned his house down in response. We see Hody and his crew later disapproving of the Ryugu Kingdom approach for peace with the humans. When Otohime was killed and the island was in shock especially those in the Fish-Man District who wanted revenge for the murder, The New Fish-Man Pirates were celebrating her killing before Hody showed his crew a bag of Energy Steroids he managed to obtain before telling his crew they were going to war against the humans.

It goes back to the present as Shirahoshi is fleeing from Hody while those in the air tank prepare to fire the bubble around Noah. Fukaboshi continues on telling Luffy that though they pushed forward to obtain peace for the island, they had failed to notice the lingering grudge of hatred in the Fish-Man District due to not keeping contact. As a result, that grudge grew out of control until it became a threat to the island. He cites his mother's death on this grudge and realizes that while it's too late to change the minds of those in Fish-Man District. The rest of the kingdom must fight within themselves to overcome this grudge or otherwise the island will be destroyed by it. Fukaboshi then pleads to Luffy to defeat the evils that have dwelled on the island and "bring everything back to zero" so they can start over again. Luffy responds in kind that he will take care of it as the moment he, his crew and Jinbe invaded the plaza they were not going to let anyone else lay a finger on the island. As after all, they are friends. These words encourage those that were escaping to stay in support of Luffy.

As all this had went on, the Ammo Knights managed to successfully fire a new air bubble over the Noah and radio Luffy of this. Hody charges at him while Luffy tells Shirahoshi to stay by his side. Luffy stretches back his arm, going  and coats it with Armament Haki. Just as Hody closes in, Luffy hits him with a new technique: , slamming it into Hody's stomach which not only greatly wounds Hody but somehow causes an explosion from Hody's back.

#### End of the Reckless Hatred: Save Fish-Man Island[]

The impact from Luffy's attack sends Hody flying towards the Noah and into the bubble around it. Luffy has Shirahoshi follow after him where they see he has crashed on the deck of the ship, badly wounded. Now in a breathable setting, Luffy charges towards Hody, activating  as he does so. Meanwhile, on the island, one of the citizens tries to convince another to flee. However, the citizen recalls when Whitebeard and his crew were on the island. As he was a friend of Neptune, he defended it from enemy pirates and proclaimed the island under his protection. The fish-men citizen, though hating humans, starts to doubt after hearing what Luffy told Fukaboshi.

Back on Noah, Hody gets to his feet and uses the water leaking from the ship to attack Luffy, sending water shots in the shape of sharks at him. Luffy dodges them however, he gets above Hody and smashes him with a . This appears to finally defeat the New Fish-Man Pirates' captain whose last thoughts are his wish that Noah destroys the island. Luffy then turns his attention to the Noah and begins to rain down his  to destroy the ship before it reaches the island. Seeing this, the Ammo Knights report this to those around the island. The news of Hody's defeat frightens some of the pirates. But only angers Zeo who starts attacking his own subordinates, citing that those who do not fight should die in the name of their grudge. Dosun follows suit when the pirates begin to realize how insane their officers have become in pursuit of their revenge.

Some fish-men children, watching this, asks if humans are really scary. A fish-man starts to respond negatively to this but is stopped by Shyarly who tells them to just watch as the ones fighting for the island's sake are humans (though has to admit she does not know what some of them are when they ask about Brook). Brook saves the pirates from Zeo, chastising the officer for talking about dying for their grudge when he does not know what it's like and that he hates people who would waste the lives of others. Zeo still thinks the Straw Hats will die in the end but Brook counters that the Straw Hats believe Luffy will be the Pirate King and if they continue to do so, nothing will frighten them. He then prepares to finish his battle with Zeo. Over with Zoro, Hyouzou notices his lack of swords and brings up his poison tentacles. Franky decides to unveil his "giant attack" to end his battle with Ikaros Much. Sanji is still on Wadatsumi who has puffed himself to gigantic proportions. Sanji finally stops playing with him and calls to Jinbe who ready their attack.

Meanwhile, the fights against Dosun and Daruma is temporarily halted when Chopper suddenly goes to his  without warning. Usopp shouts if that was necessary as the battle had not become desperate enough to use it. But much to his surprise, Chopper still retains his intelligence in that form and tells Usopp he is alright.

Chopper reveals that when he eats a rumble ball now, he can transform to his monster point for at least three minutes now. Usopp compliments him which causes Chopper to, of course, dance while saying he is not happy. Both Dosun and Daruma go to continue their attacks. However, some plants which Usopp calls "Humandrake" jump out at Daruma and knock him down. Then another plant called "Trampolia" shoots him into the air allowing Usopp to prepare his final shot. Over with Franky and Ikaros Much, the latter takes off his helmet to unveil a spear-like hair which he prepares to attack Franky with while Franky prepares his own attack. Zoro tires of Hyouzou and tells him to get lost, calling him a frog. Hyouzou however, goes to attack him from behind. With Sanji, Jinbe, and Wadatsumi, Wadatsumi threatens to use his size to flatten all in the plaza which Jinbe takes as a cue. And finally with Brook and Zeo, Zeo warns Brook not to get too close to his space or he will crush him.

Brook, however, does move forward and in an instant is already behind Zeo. Before Zeo realizes anything, he is cut by Brook's ice sword attack and defeated. Usopp fires his final shot at Daruma who thinks he can just bite the attack. However, Usopp reveals that the bulb from the Pop Green releases a shockwave, knocking him out. Dosun spins, swinging his hammer wildly toward Chopper. But with one massive swipe, Chopper sends him flying much to his troops surprise. Ikaros Much charges at Franky intending to impale him but Franky counters with a laser beam, turning him into roasted squid in an instant (Chopper and Usopp marvel at this as usual while Nami and Robin remain indifferent).

Jinbe rears back his fist and hits Wadatsumi with . Despite the Fish-Man Pirates thinking there is no way he can launch something so big, Jinbe's attack goes right through Wadatsumi and sends him flying into the air. Sanji follows after him and, remembering his training, suddenly catches on fire and kicks the giant with  an attack that burns him completely. Lastly, Hyouzou charges at Zoro intending to poison him, citing he the best swordsman of Fish-Man Island. Annoyed, Zoro cuts him with  that completely trashes the rest of Hyouzou's swords and defeats him. With this, all of the officers of the New Fish-Man Pirates were defeated.

Both the citizens and the crew begin to celebrate but its short-lived as the threat of Noah is still incoming. As the now leader-less New Fish-Man Pirates start to run for it, the citizens of the island start cheering for Luffy who continues to try to smash the ship before it hits the island. Even Fukaboshi and King Neptune agree it's the only way, with the latter apologizing to Joy Boy for having to destroy the ship. However, in the hail of his  attack, Shirahoshi swims through it crying out for Luffy to stop. When he demands to know why, Shirahoshi reveals that Sea Kings came to her aid and grabbed the chains around the ship, preventing it from falling further. Seeing this, Luffy stops and faints from blood loss thanks to the bite wound Hody gave him, falling to a lower section of the ship. Meanwhile, the Sea King communicate with the princess, telling her that they had come due to her strong feelings for Luffy, also complimenting the Straw Hat's strength as well.

The Ammo Knights, seeing what has happened, report to the entire island that Noah was stopped and was not completely destroyed either. Thus, Fish-Man Island was saved, and everyone begins to celebrate for real. The report reaches Neptune and the princes who are surprised of Shirahoshi's awakened ability. Meanwhile, the bubble around Noah is absorbed by the island with Luffy falling with the rubble of the ship. Shirahoshi rushes to save him while the Sea Kings tow Noah to the Sea Forest. They have conversation with each other about how Luffy seemed to understand them like that of Gol D. Roger. They also worry if the ship can be fixed in time for the "promised day." Sometime later, Neptune receives a report about the kidnapped mermaid girls that were found at the castle, unharmed though dazed and unclear of their kidnapper. However, all the treasure in the castle was stolen, including the Tamatebako. Neptune brushes off the lost treasure as he cites that losing the country was of greater importance. He declares the Straw Hats cleared off all crimes and tells the guard to report it over the island.

Over in the plaza, Hody's now freed slaves beg Jinbe to let them through the exit, citing their actions were out of fear of Hody. However, Jinbe refuses till he gets word from Neptune. Back in the plaza, the Straw Hats are resting from the battle along with Surume and Megalo. Chopper barely able to move as the  had drained most of his energy though said that he can still treat people. Neptune and the princes soon arrive back in the plaza, the latter carrying the defeated Decken and Hody. Once on the ground, the two are bound in chains, Fukaboshi declaring that the two will never be free again. Shirahoshi suddenly come carrying Luffy, crying for someone to save him as he has lost too much blood. Chopper gets to work though needs Robin's help to him stay upright. He manages to stop the bleeding but said that Luffy needs a transfusion to regain the blood lost. He begs the citizens to help him with an F-Blood Type. However, the citizens are hesitant due to the law declaring they cannot give blood to humans. Shirahoshi wishes to help but her blood is not the right type. However, Jinbe suddenly steps up and offers his as his blood type is the same as Luffy's, declaring himself a pirate when the law is brought up. Neptune does not stop him, saying that the law is just another form of the island's curse.

And so, the transfusion is done with everyone looking on. Luffy manages to come to, to the joy of Shirahoshi, his crew, and everyone on the island. He then turns to Jinbe and, with his usual grin, asks him to join his crew.

#### Aftermath of the Battle: A Promise, a Party, Poseidon and a Prelude to a New Situation[]

Neptune frees Hody's slaves who are more than happy to leave the island. When asked by his ministers if that is wise, Neptune comments that the island was always a resting spot for pirates, so they have no reason to keep them there. He then turns his attention to the remnants of the New Fish-Man Pirates. They plead they had no idea that Hody was responsible for Otohime's death. Neptune allows them to stay on the island under a sentence of community service for their crimes. He also declares that the Fish-Man District will be blocked off from the island and no one will be allowed to live there. Neptune then asks about the Straw Hats and Fukaboshi tell him they ran away.

The Sunny flies over the island with Shirahoshi following. Zoro comments that they left in a hurry because they did not want to be viewed as heroes (though contradicts himself about wanting to drink booze). Luffy meanwhile, is complaining to Jinbe about not coming with them. Jinbe admits he is flattered that Luffy asked him but says he has things he needs to do. However, when his task is done, he promises the crew he will join them then. Luffy agrees with this as does the rest of the crew. Neptune soon catches up with them and reminds them he still owes the Straw Hats a banquet. This is enough to get Luffy to stay, and he has Hatchan and Camie picked up as well.

The Fish-Man District is soon taped off and the New Fish-Man Pirates officers along with Vander Decken IX are thrown into the dungeon. As they do not have a cell big enough, the Ammo Knights have Surume take Wadatsumi to a far-off location banning him from entering the country. The rest of the island prepares for the banquet. Soon the Straw Hats reach Ryugu Palace, and the party start properly. Everyone enjoys themselves celebrating the victory for the island.

After some time, Robin manages to get Neptune alone and asks about Joy Boy. Neptune reveals that Joy Boy lived during the Void Century and that the apology he wrote was to the Mermaid Princess of the time, apparently for breaking a promise to the island. While he does not know the details, it was passed down through the Ryugu family that someone on behalf of Joy Boy would fulfill the promise which is why he is determined to protect Noah so it may be used on the "promised day."

Robin mentions that the Sea Kings dropped the Noah off at the forest and asks if Joy Boy had the power to communicate with then. Neptune says no, saying that power always rested with the Mermaid Princess and that Shirahoshi has fully awakened her power after the battle though he is not happy about it. Robin brings up the Poneglyph she found in  Skypiea which told of the location of the Ancient Weapon being on Fish-Man Island. She deduces that the Mermaid Princess had another name which Shirahoshi inherited, that is also the name of the weapon. That name being  Poseidon.

Neptune mentions that she is one of the  three legendary weapons along with  Pluton and  Uranus and that it would be trouble if the World Government were to find out about her. Unbeknownst to Neptune and Robin, Caribou is eavesdropping on their conversation in his mud-like state and starts plotting. Meanwhile, Luffy and Jinbe break away from the party to talk, running into the other members who are taking a break as well. Jinbe then explains what went on during the two years they were training: Firstly, that  Akainu has become the new  Fleet Admiral. He explains that after  Sengoku recommended that  Aokiji take the position. The  Five Elders interjected, wishing for Akainu to take the job. Aokiji objected strongly to this, so both admirals went to an  island to settle the dispute with a fight. After ten days of fighting, Akainu wound up the victor. However, he spared Aokiji's life who left the Marines sometime afterwards.

Jinbe continues that the Marines suffered in power as a result through the Government is giving them "unseen power" as a result. He tells the crew to remember two things; that the Marines have becomes stronger with Akainu at the helm and the threat of the  Blackbeard Pirates who have conquered Whitebeard's territory since his death (due  Blackbeard knowing the areas from being in his crew). Jinbe continues with saying the World Government now marks him alongside  Shanks,  Kaidou, Big Mom and labels him as one of the Four Emperors. The Blackbeard Pirates are now "power hunting" meaning they are searching and killing anyone with a strong Devil Fruit power and taking it from them. Jinbe warns Luffy to be on the watch as there was some bad blood against the two since the war.

However, Luffy stops listening midway through and when scolded, says he likes to leave everything to chance. He then goes to check on Shirahoshi, sensing something wrong alongside Zoro and Sanji. The three arrive just in time to prevent Caribou from kidnapping the Mermaid Princess and knock him out of the tower. When Neptune and the Ministers arrive, they mention the treasure Caribou took which peaks Nami's interest. Neptune says he would be happy to give it to the Straw Hats as he does not view it as important as the country. Upon hearing this, Nami forces the monster trio to look for Caribou. One of the Ammo Guards suddenly appear and informs Neptune that something happened at Hody's cell. The group head to the prison to find the New Fish-Man Pirates now all rapidly aged into old men. The Minister of the Right and Neptune realizes that Hody acquired the Energy Steroid pills from the Tamatebako which was said to give the user a boost in strength but also age them as well. Despite the empty threats the aged Hody throws at them. Neptune and Fukaboshi take pity on the group, with the latter even forgiving Hody for killing his mother.

Meanwhile, the Minister of the Left is informed that two of Big Mom's messengers,  Sir Pekoms and  Baron Tamago, have arrived to check on the status of the  Candy Factory. Unfortunately, the factory was destroyed by the New Fish-Man Pirates, and they had given the undamaged sweets to the Straw Hats. Upon hearing this, the Minister of the Right worries if any excuse they give them will please Big Mom, who would destroy an entire country just in the name of sweets.

Meanwhile, the rest of the crew meet up with Shirahoshi and are informed of the treasure offering as well as what Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are doing. While Shirahoshi is worried, Nami assures her that the three will be alright. Sure enough, the Monster Trio quickly find Caribou with Luffy having beaten him with one punch. With him defeated, the treasure he stole spills out from his body. The three collect the treasure and head back to the palace. Meanwhile, the Minister of the Left is speaking with Sir Pekoms, a suited walking lion, in hopes of reasoning with him about the lack of candy, though he reminds the Minister what Big Mom will do if they do not deliver. The Monster Trio arrive on the scene and are initially greeted by the citizens, least until Luffy mentions how great the sweets were during the banquet. This angers Pekoms until he has calmed down by his partner, Baron Tamago, a  Longleg Tribesman also wearing a suit (and  his lower part wearing half an egg for some reason). He explains to Luffy the deal Fish-Man Island made for protection in exchange for ten tons of candy per month.

As he tells Luffy this, we go to an island in the New World called  Whole Cake Island. Big Mom expresses her excitement over the planned  Tea Party they are having in four days. However, when a  subordinate mentions he is excited too, she spontaneously eats him. Some of her crew arrive, led by a man named  Bobbin who have just come from an island they burned down as the island failed to produce the baked goods promised to them. He also mentions he got a call from Pekoms about Fish-Man Island's lack of a candy offering. Needless to say, Big Mom is not pleased to hear this and demands a Den Den Mushi.

Back on Fish-Man Island, Tamago gives the island until tomorrow morning to come up with the candy. But The Minister of the Left states that the equipment was damaged, and it will take at least two weeks to fix. It's then Sanji and Zoro speak up asking what will happen if Big Mom does not get her candy which Tamago answers she will send her "beasts" in to raze the island. Luffy grows angry upon hearing this, especially since they just saved the island. The Den Den Mushi suddenly rings much to Pekoms and Tamago's fear. Before they can answer, Luffy swipes it away from them and speaks with Big Mom. Stating who he is and that he was the one who ate the candy to the shock of  Big Mom's subordinates and the Fish-Man Island citizens. Luffy offers his treasure in exchange for overlooking the lack of sweets. Realizing he is serious, Tamago takes over and tries to convince Big Mom to take the offer as two of their ships were destroyed by  Captain Kid and they need the money, even stating he will bring back all the sweets in two weeks' time.

Big Mom, however, refuses such an offer but decides to spare Fish-Man Island to instead go after Luffy. She challenges Luffy to come to the New World. Luffy instantly accepts adding that it's too dangerous to leave her in charge of Fish-Man Island. He declares he will defeat her and take Fish-Man Island as his own territory.

Meanwhile, Jinbe speaks with Neptune, explaining that the Sun Pirates were doing fine under Big Mom though his crew was only doing so out of concern for Fish-Man Island after Whitebeard's death. However, Jinbe mentions that he is thinking of cutting ties with Big Mom and joining up with Luffy though worries how Big Mom will react. Neptune understands even mentioning that if they lost Big Mom's  flag they can always use "the Skull and Crossbones wearing a Straw Hat" much to Jinbe's amusement and agreement.

The Minister of the Right later meets up with Neptune, frantically explaining they needed to retrieve the Tamatebako from the Straw Hats as he had rigged it with a bomb after Hody had managed to open it 10 years ago. Neptune just tells him to explain the situation and ask them to return the box when they return. At that instant Luffy, Zoro and Sanji make it back but much to the group's shock find that he gave all the treasure to Pekoms and Tamago plus decided to pick a fight with Big Mom. Jinbe realizes he will really have to leave before things get bad while Neptune worries that if Big Mom finds the Tamatebako and opens it, it will seem like a declaration of war from Luffy. Nami however is more furious that they gave the rest of the treasure away, beating the Monster Trio senseless over it.

Meanwhile, Caribou has awakened from his beating and is searching for whomever took his treasure, commenting that if he brought back the secret of the Mermaid Princess and the treasure, he would gain bonus points with a certain someone. He comes upon the factory and sees Pekoms and Tamago leaving with said treasure, yelling for them to give it back. Pekoms checks his bounty lists and sees Caribou is currently worth 200,000,000 much to the citizen's shock. Caribou unveils a Gatling gun from his torso and fires at them. Pekoms is hit but reveals he has a Devil Fruit too which allows him to shield himself in a  turtle shell. As Pekoms reforms and puts his clothes back on, Caribou pulls out a scythe and goes to strike him. But Pekoms hits him with a Haki infused punch and knocks him out instantly. It is then revealed that Pekoms has a 330,000,000 bounty on him. Tamago and him decide to head back to Big Mom.

As that goes on, on the surface near the  Red Line, the pirates that were leaving Fish-Man Island come across a Marine blockade. One of the pirate ships fires on a certain Marine ship which the crew call for  Tashigi, now a  Captain to the  G-5 base, to help them. Indeed, she does, deflecting a cannonball away from the ship with her sword then scolds her subordinates for their goofiness. Meanwhile,  Smoker, now a Vice Admiral, interrogates some captured pirates who explain they were held captive by Hody Jones in Fish-Man Island. They try to keep it secret that it was Luffy who defeated him out of debt for saving them, but one of the pirates lets this slip. However, Smoker could already tell who it was just based on their story alone.

#### Farewell to Fish-Man Island: Let's Sail into the New World[]

After some time, the Straw Hats prepare to leave. Camie asks Madam Shyarly if she can go see them off, followed by the rest of the mermaids. Shyarly permits this but Camie stays behind for a bit. Shyarly reveals she broke her crystal ball as she has no desire to see the future again though Camie knows Shyarly is still worried about the prediction even if it has not come to pass recently, it may sometime in the near future. Regardless, Shyarly apologizes to Camie for suspecting Luffy.

Meanwhile at the dock, the Ryugu Family, the ministers, Hatchan and most of the Fish-Man Island residents have come to see the Straw Hats off. Shirahoshi is sad to see them leave though Luffy just chides her for crying. The Minster of the Right is still worried about the Tamatebako that was in the treasure Luffy gave to Big Mom. Though Neptune points it out that the bomb inside of it might be a dud after years of resting inside it. Meanwhile, the Minister of the Left gives Nami a new Log Pose which has three needles on it. He explains that their original Log Pose relied on an island's magnetic force to guide them to an island. But in the New World, the magnetic force is constantly changing thus making a normal one useless. The new Log Pose however, will point to these different magnetic forces meaning that from here on out they will have to choose their own route. He also adds that the more a needle shakes the more dangerous an island will be. Nami begins to freak out upon hearing this, but Luffy becomes excited about the prospect of unknown danger much to the dismay of Nami, Chopper and Usopp.

Franky soon calls to the crew that he has got the ship ready to head up. And the island's residents which include Hatchan, Camie, Pappag, the Mermaid Cafe, and the Princess, say their goodbyes. Luffy calls out to Jinbe who only nods in recognition as a reminder of his promise. As the crew sail off, they are caught up by Shirahoshi who vows that if they meet again, she will not cry anymore and asks if Luffy will take her on another walk, this time outside the ocean. Luffy agrees to this affirming with a pinky promise, the rest of the crew join in too as they take it as their responsibility as well. With that, the crew set sail and leave Fish-Man Island, who now have a clearer outlook on humans. Meanwhile, the crew head for the surface, Luffy more excited than ever as he will finally be on the seas of his idol, Shanks. As he remembers all the people who believe he will accomplish his dream, his crew become more pumped than ever. Thus, the Straw Hats prepare themselves to enter the final ocean, the New World.

## Dressrosa Saga

### __Punk Hazard Arc__

#### Entering the New World: A Distress Call to a New Adventure[]

As the  Straw Hats leave from  Fish-Man Island, the crew has some free time.  Nami decides to spend hers having a bath, using a new  as a shower with  Chopper (and unknown to her,  Sanji and  Brook) looking on. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew has decided to go fishing.  Luffy knocks out one fish but it just attracts a bigger one, and that fish attracts an even bigger eel.  Zoro kills it, but the weight of the fish brings the ship to a stop. To make matters worse, an underwater maelstrom, called the  White Strom, suddenly appears in front of them. The eel gets sucked into it dragging the  Thousand Sunny into it.

After a wild ride, the ship suddenly hits something, and the crew realizes it is a pod of  Island Whales. Luffy mistakes the whale they hit for  Laboon.  Brook starts crying and calling out to them, though calmed down by  Usopp afterwards. Nami realizes that even though they got out of the maelstrom, the current caused by the pod is still dangerous to them and they need to raise the sails to ride it. As the crew does so, Brook starts to sing  Binks' Sake. This attracts the attention of a whale who gives them a ride. After a bit, the Straw Hats reach the surface. Despite the thunderous seas around them, the crew is excited for the new challenges that await them.

In the distance, Luffy sees a volcano erupting on an island and decides to head there even though none of the  New World Log Pose needles are pointing there. Sanji tells Luffy that he managed to cut off some meat, but the fish that they had caught had been burnt to a crisp by the sea of flames. Usopp is concerned about the Sunny, but  Franky assures him that the ship will not lose. Suddenly, Luffy hears the  Den Den Mushi ringing, but  Robin states that there is a 50% chance that the distress signal is merely an ambush set by the  Marines. Luffy decides to answer anyway and hears a man calling for help, stating that the unit is being killed by a samurai, and that they are on  Punk Hazard. However, the man is presumably killed before the conversation can continue. Zoro questions Brook about the  samurai, who answers that samurais are the  swordsmen of  Wano Country, who have a closed-door policy to outsiders and are not affiliated with the  World Government. Luffy decides to go rescue him at the nearest island, the one with the volcano.

Meanwhile, on a  G-5 Marine ship,  Vice Admiral  Smoker is commenting that while there were three islands the Straw Hats could have gone to, but they have somehow gone to Punk Hazard, which was closed off due to an incident four years ago. Back at the Sunny, the crewmates draw straws to see who will go with Luffy. Zoro, Robin and Usopp get the "winning" straws. Sanji hands Luffy a deep-sea fish lunchbox, and Nami forms a cloud road over the flames and the adventure party sets out on the  Mini Merry II. While the others eat, Usopp is frightened to go to the island, stating that he has the "Can't set foot on new islands" disease.

#### Arriving at Punk Hazard: The Adventure on the Burning Island[]

The four arrive at the shore, pulling Mini Merry II onto the beach and find a large metal gate bearing the World Government and Marine logos warning them to stay out. When they reach the gates of the island, Zoro cuts it down, as they trespass further. Usopp panics, warning them both that they are going to incur the wrath of the World Government, but then remembers they had already done so many times.

Despite Usopp's fear, the crew enters, finding it blazing-hot with most of the buildings melted. Looking at the structures, Robin deduces the buildings to be a former government base. As they walk along, Usopp comments on how strange it is that the man on the Den Den Mushi remarked on the coldness of the island despite the intense heat. Luffy wondered if he was just stupid, while Robin pondered if there was a cold area somewhere on this island. On the Thousand Sunny, Nami remarks that the clouds on the opposite side of the island are snow clouds, while Luffy's group finds a city half melted, still burning. As they begin to explore, they stumble upon a massive skull bigger than a giant's that had perished during this catastrophe.

Suddenly, they turn around and see a monster that they thought could only exist in fairy tales: a  dragon. The dragon seemingly talks, and asks who they are. Suddenly, the dragon attacks, breathing fire, forcing the Straw Hats to escape the attack. Luffy attacks the dragon but hardly deals any damage because the dragon's scales are so hard. The dragon sends Luffy flying, and Zoro starts attacking it, only to discover that not only is the dragon resistant to damage but also strong. It seemingly starts to speak again, asking them if they are allies with "that  Warlord of the Sea". Luffy rockets up to the dragon's back and makes it bite its wing, wounding it and noticing some human legs on the dragon's head. Zoro is then shot into the air by Usopp and decapitates the dragon with a single slash.

Meanwhile back at the Thousand Sunny, Sanji prepares a special dish for Nami, only to realize that everybody on the ship was asleep. He realizes the scent of gas on the ship. He attempts to contact Luffy's group via a Den Den Mushi, but before reaching it, he also falls asleep. Afterwards, some strange people appear on the ship and decide to take the pirates, except for Brook, to "M", their master.

Back at Punk Hazard, Luffy decides to pull the legs out of the dragon's head in order to save him. Soon, everybody realizes that the "person" is missing half of his body. Luffy thinks that he killed him, but then hears the legs talk, and then the legs try to attack them in vain, after which the legs run away. Luffy screams at him to join the crew with Usopp yelling at his captain that he needs to stop doing that.

Luffy then catches up to the legs, and gets stuck to him, calling himself a centaur. The Straw Hats then see the other side of the island, which is cold looking, and has a mountain made of ice. Usopp realizes this is where the distress call must have come from. Usopp then looks into the sky, and sees a winged woman, he tries to point it out, but she disappears, and he is the only one to see her.

Meanwhile, Sanji, Chopper, Franky, and Nami wake up in a room on the island. They recall what happened on the ship before they fell asleep, and infer that they must have been carried there after they were all asleep. They then notice there are pieces of a head in the room with them. They put the head together (although his top of head and chin reversed), and the head tells them that he was cut up by someone he does not know. After finding out that they are  pirates, the head exclaims that he hates pirates so much they make him sick. The head then reveals to them where they are, the frozen half of Punk Hazard. The crew decides to break out, so Franky uses his  to blow the door down. Sanji picks up the head and arranges him correctly, revealing to be a samurai. Then the crew emerges into a room filled with  giant children.

#### One Mystery After Another: The Island's Secrets Unfold[]

The children ask if the group is part of the frozen people while most of the boys gush over seeing Franky's  robotic appearance. Nami notes there are regular-sized kids there as well before the samurai asks the kids if they had seen a boy named  Momonosuke. However, his appearance frightens the kids. The hazmat attackers soon reach the room, forcing Nami's group to run for it. As they do, one of the kids, a giant boy, begs the group to take them off the island. The other kids join in, telling the group that they have recovered from whatever sickness they have had and wish to go back home, which immediately concerns the Straw Hats. Nami, though at first reluctant, agrees to their pleas and vows to save them. Sanji and Franky are opposed to the idea, but when Nami declares she cannot turn her back on crying children, the lovestruck Sanji gives in and attacks their pursuers. Franky backs him up with his trademark "super" punch and they both stay behind to hold them off while Nami and Chopper run off with the kids.

Meanwhile, some of the hazmat crew are looking over the damage to the Straw Hat's cell conversing with their " Master," an odd floating  gaseous being. The gas recognizes the melted steel as the aftermath of only one possible weapon: the lasers of  Vegapunk's  Pacifista, which unbeknownst to him Franky now possesses. One of his men then report one of the G-5's ships on the shore of the island, to which the gas commands that they get rid of it.

Elsewhere, the winged-woman Usopp spotted talks to someone on portable Den Den Mushi about the four intruders as she makes her way over a frozen area. With Luffy's group, Usopp speaks with Brook, who finally awakened after being gassed. He explains what happened and that he took care of his captors, but not before the Thousand Sunny was moved to the snowy section of the island. The connection cuts out before he can explain more. However, the group has bigger concerns as they have run into a  centaur with the body of a leopard. He is initially friendly with Luffy believing he too is a centaur after seeing him attached to the disembodied legs. Upon finding out he is not, the centaur attacks Luffy, who easily takes him down. Robin stops another centaur, this one with the body of a giraffe, that was trying to sneak up on Luffy. Usopp checks them over and finds a Den Den Mushi with the name "CC" imprinted on it, surmising it to represent the initials of some unified centaur clan. With another mysterious clue on their hands, the group progresses to locate their friends.

Meanwhile Smoker's ship has arrived in the frozen part of the island, but the crew comment they cannot get close with poison gas in the air, confusing the recently deployed sleep gas for the alleged poisonous danger of Punk Hazard. Smoker disagrees, commenting that two years ago the island was nothing more than a poison-free barren wasteland, and correctly guesses the remnants of gas are very recent. However, that all that changed when it became the site for the battle between  Aokiji and  Akainu, which forever changed the climate in the aftermath of their fight of near-mythical proportions.

The G-5 Marines then discuss the gas on the island, and put on gas masks to protect themselves. The warship almost crashes into a wall of ice, but the ship manages to blast their way through.

Meanwhile, Luffy's group notices a blizzard on the frozen side of the island, and Robin explains that it must be due to the temperature difference on the island itself. The crew then realizes that they need a boat to cross the river, and at first it is suggested that they ride on the other crew members' backs who do not have  Devil Fruit abilities, but this is quickly refuted when Usopp uses one of his  Pop Green to create a banana boat to cross the river. Usopp remarks that he gained plenty of pop greens by going deep into the  Boin Archipelago. The crew gets into the boat and begin to make their way across, but one of the centaurs throws a rock at the ship right as they are rowing across the river. Luffy once again asks the centaur to join his crew, which he is scolded for by the other members; excluding Robin. The centaur then asks his boss to finish off the crew, and Usopp recognizes the term as the same one from the distress call, they received via the Den Den Mushi. The boss of the centaurs then arrives, and is shown to be a giant shadowy figure, and the crew realize that this is who the distress call was meant for. The boss then mistakes Zoro for the samurai who cut down his men.

Back in the Biscuits Room, the crew continues to fight the gas masked men. The gas masked men then prepare to unleash the gas, but are stopped by Sanji when he kicks off their masks. Sanji then notices that the men under the gas masks look like sheep. The samurai suddenly commenting that "this guy" is no easy feat much to Franky's confusion before the samurai reveals his torso is fighting someone.

Meanwhile, on Brook's side, Brook is fighting said Samurai's torso, and mistakes it for a ghost. The torso tries to attack Brook, but Brook deflects the attack and begins to run away, noting that the torso uses a two-sword style.

Meanwhile, in the Master's room, he is informed that Smoker has arrived on the island. He commands his men to hide the ships in front of the facility, and to hide themselves. He then turns into gas and puts himself inside a beaker.

#### Warlord of the Sea vs. Marines, Straw Hats vs. Centaurs[]

Elsewhere, Smoker and his battalion have finally emerged onto the landmass. They arrive at a door, ready to arrest anyone who is there. Out of the door emerges  Trafalgar Law, now one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Law asks Smoker why he is at his vacation home, and the Marines reveal that Law sent one hundred hearts to the World Government to get his position as a Warlord of the Sea. Smoker tells Law that even to people concerned with the government that Punk Hazard is off limits, to which Law counters that the same applies to Smoker too.

Meanwhile, in Nami's group, the kids reveal that their parents asked the Punk Hazard staff to cure them, and that the staff came one day, and took them, without letting them say goodbye, due to the danger of the disease. Nami requests that Chopper check them later to see if they have really been cured, and he agrees. The group reaches a dead end, but Chopper attacks the door button, and the door opens. Nami immediately says that it is freezing in the room and asks Chopper to lend her his fur. The kids then exclaim that they do not wish to go in there, because it looks scary, and because of the fact that there is something around them. The group looks around and discovers that there are frozen bodies lined up throughout the room. Chopper and Nami then run out, with the kids following behind.

Back in the Biscuits Room, Sanji and Franky discover the lower half of the Punk Hazard staff's bodies are those of sheep. The samurai head then exclaims to Sanji to let him go, and that he will search for his son on his own, because he did not observe him in the group of kids. Sanji says he cannot do that, because he would feel guilty, and asks the samurai where his body is located. The samurai then says that he does not want to be indebted to pirates, and that he would not ask them even if he died. He then says that if on the off chance they may wish to find his body themselves, then he does not mind them looking for it. Sanji then gets angry, and almost smashes the head onto the ground, if not for Franky, and then proceeds to beating him up for previous comments.

Back in front of the facility,  Tashigi plays the recording of the distress call, while Smoker and Law listen. The recording ends, and Smoker says that the distress call came from this island, without a doubt, due to the description of the island, and island name. Smoker then recalls that Law knows Luffy from the Saint  Rosward incident and fought with him and  Eustass Kid against the Marines. Then he recalls Law's rescue of Luffy from  Marineford. Law tells Smoker that he knows of the forgery of emergency signals, but Smoker tells him that the distress call is real, to which Law replies that he knows nothing, so there is nothing to talk about. Smoker then asks Law to let him see the inside of the research facility, but Law tells him no, because it is currently his vacation home. Law tells Smoker if he sees Luffy on the island, he will hunt him down, and that there is nothing to worry about, so they should leave.

Nami's group then suddenly bursts out of the facility, which surprises everybody. Franky then busts out of the facility in his  tank form, with Sanji and the samurai head, and two children with him. The G-5 Marines, were stunned, stating that they cannot even begin to name what is weird there. Chopper then recognizes Law from  Sabaody Archipelago, and accuses him of kidnapping the children, and says that Law will never get them back. Sanji also notices Smoker and Tashigi, who wonder to themselves why there are kids here. Realizing that there are Marines blocking their part, the Straw Hats redirect the children back into the facility and tell them to go towards the back door.

Smoker then asks Law why he lied to him, to which Law replies that he is still surprised that they were actually there. The Marines then start to run after the Straw Hats but are stopped in shock when Law uses his  Devil Fruit ability to capsize their warship. Law states that he cannot let them leave the island anymore, and Smoker begins to fight Law.

At the lake in the center of the island, Luffy, Zoro, Robin, and Usopp have their plant boat shot out from under them by centaurs on the side of the lake, forcing Zoro and Usopp to support Luffy and Robin. Zoro moves to attack, but a shark drags him beneath the surface, revealing that the lake is actually an extension of the ocean due to a massive rift made by Aokiji and Akainu's duel. The centaurs prepare to finish the job, but Brook freezes their gun barrels shut, causing their weapons to backfire. This gives Zoro, Luffy, Robin, and Usopp time to defeat the sharks and emerge from the water dripping wet and frozen. They then decide to attack the centaurs and steal their warm clothes.

Back at Vegapunk's former research facility, Law has sliced the warship in half and placed half of it on a rock, rendering it unusable. Law then swaps the minds of the escaping Straw Hats and steals all the Den Den Mushi from the Marines, preventing them from contacting the World Government. Smoker attacks Law, who dodges and slices up many Marines using his Devil Fruit ability. Tashigi tries to attack, despite Smoker's order, but is cut in half and has her  Shigure cleaved in two by Law. Tashigi says that being cut but not dying is a shame to a swordsman, but Law tells her that weaklings cannot decide how they want to die, making her try to attack him again. The Marines shoot at Law, but he simply switches the bullets with snow at their feet, avoiding injury. Law moves to cut Tashigi again, but Smoker blocks him and smashes him to the ground with his  Devil Fruit ability. Law escapes, and the two of them clash, sending the warship pieces flying and forcing the Marines to retreat.

Meanwhile, Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Robin, and Brook have defeated the centaurs, stolen their warm clothes, and forced their leader,  Brownbeard, to carry them to the other side of the island. Back at Vegapunk's former research facility, the gaseous entity that is the master of the satyrs meets with  Monet, who tells him about the arrival of the Straw Hat Pirates on the island. Outside, Smoker attacks Law with his jutte, but Law dodges and uses his Mes attack to literally encase and steal Smoker's heart from his body, defeating him. At this moment, Luffy arrives and is surprised to see Law.

#### Scrambled Hearts: The Truth of the Island[]

Luffy expresses his gratitude to Law for saving his life two years prior, and then also asks where the  talking bear is, which leads to Law having a flashback to his departure from  Amazon Lily. Law tells Luffy that there is no need to express gratitude, and that he just acted on a whim at the time. Law states that the two are still pirates, to which Luffy replies that he is right, and that they will be enemies if he is also going after the  One Piece. Luffy then notices the unconscious marines, and notices Smoker and the hole in his chest. Tashigi, who is now attached to her body, charges after Law, but is easily stopped when Law switches Tashigi and Smoker's minds. As the Straw Hats run from the Marines, Luffy says he wants to ask Law something, to which Law replies that he should go to the back of the research facility to find what he is looking for, and that they will meet again soon. With these final words, Law re-enters the facility.

Meanwhile, behind the research facility, Sanji goes hysterical over being in Nami's body, and the kids ask the crew if their bodies have been switched. The kids then exclaim that they are cold and cannot move any further. The samurai tells everybody to put leaves or rocks on their heads, and when they do this, they suddenly are covered with coats. The samurai explains that he ate an "unusual fruit", that gave him the power to disguise himself and others, but with the side effect that the clothes will disappear as soon as they are taken off. Suddenly, Luffy's group arrives in time to witnesses Nami in Franky's body hitting Sanji in her body.

The crew notices that the area looked destroyed due to explosives. The samurai reattaches himself to his legs, and it is explained to the crew that he is the reason the distress call was made due to him slicing up the centaurs, and that the distress call was actually meant for Brownbeard. The samurai says that he only did it to save his son, and that he sliced anybody that got in his way. He comes to the conclusion that his son must still be inside. It is then explained to Luffy that Law is now a Warlord of the Sea, much to Luffy's surprise. The samurai states that Law cut his body into pieces, and his legs accidentally ended up stuck to the dragon. It is also explained why it seemed like the legs could talk, which was due to the samurai's excessive farting. Brook then tells the group that he encountered the missing torso, but he ran away from it and does not know where it is.

Meanwhile, in the newly founded G-5 Marine shelter, Smoker, in Tashigi's body realizes what the CC he saw on the ships actually stood for. He reveals to his company that it is none other than the infamous Caesar Clown, who was a former colleague of Dr. Vegapunk, a wanted felon, and an expert on mass-murder weapons.

Tashigi, in Smoker's body, reveals that there have been reports of kids dying or going missing near the island but whenever a ship was sent to investigate, it was just chalked up to a being shipwrecks. Smoker comes to the conclusion that the incidents were being falsified and there is a mole within G-5 doing it. When the squad protests, Smoker retorts that as long as humans run the world there will be no "perfect society." He orders his troops to commandeer one of the enemy's ships and notify  Marine Headquarters, claiming he cannot leave the island until he gets his body and mind back away from Law's control.

Inside the facility, Caesar has called someone on the Den Den Mushi named " Joker" who has given him permission to eliminate the Straw Hats, the G-5 soldiers and someone called  Kin'emon the Will-O-Wisp and sends his minions to capture them, even allowing them to use poison if they have to. Monet is curious why the Straw Hat Pirates would return to action after two years before the centaurs from before are carried into the room near freezing from having their clothes stolen. They inform Caesar that the Straw Hats captured Brownbeard. Caesar shows concern for the centaur's welfare and offers them a medicine which will heal them.

Meanwhile with the Straw Hats, Usopp has made mini masks for the switched members so they can tell apart who is who. Luffy talks with the tied up Brownbeard who states he loathes those that make up the " Worst Generation", which are comprised of  Marshall D. Teach and the Eleven Supernovas. He reveals he lost  his crew and his legs thanks to  Basil Hawkins and wound up on Punk Hazard, claiming it was once an island full of greenery as well as a research facility for Vegapunk who developed weapons and drugs for the military. Some criminals were even brought to the island instead of prison for experimentation.

Around four years ago, a chemical experiment failed and destroyed two of the three labs which make up the ruins of the island. The gas released from the explosion killed the plant life and the laboratories' personnel fled, leaving behind the prisoners. Those that were in the untouched facility survived and holed up there but those unlucky few on the outside were paralyzed from the legs down by the nerve gas. Then one year later, their master, Caesar, appeared, cured them of the poison with his powers and made devices that allowed them to float off the ground.

Brownbeard ended up on the island a year after his crew were wiped out and had given up hope when he was found by Caesar and his group. Not too long after that, Law arrived and used his abilities to replace the handicapped limbs with parts of animals. When asked about the dragon Luffy's group encountered, it was revealed it was a creature made by Vegapunk to guard the island which could adapt to any environment. The  World Noble kept it as one of their own later on, though Brownbeard is unaware that Luffy's group killed it. Brownbeard then finishes that Caesar is doing research for the sake of humanity and that the Straw Hats will be caught and turned into specimens.

Back in Vegapunk's lab, one of the centaurs is taking the special treatment but all the effects only sicken him further before Caesar kills him outright. Monet claims it as a failure, but Caesar disagrees, claiming the explosion he did four years ago was part of his schemes. Caesar vows to show the World Government that he will prove he is the greatest scientist in the world.

Back with Smoker, he tells his men that Caesar was actually the one that set off the chemical incident four years ago and Vegapunk was blamed for it. He states that his work in mass murder weapons was illegal and because of how dangerous he was they arrested him, but Caesar managed to escape. Smoker states that if Caesar is continuing his research now, then there will be another incident like before if they do not stop him soon.

#### Peek-a-Boo! Giant Children and the Snowy Mountains' Assassins[]

Back with the Straw Hats, Franky is messing around with Chopper's  Point Transformations while Brook tells Sanji that the samurai with them had gone off to find his torso. Sanji, feeling responsible for the samurai, heads out to look for him with Brook accompanying (though really both want to look at Nami's panties). Nami overhears this however and forces Zoro to go with them to keep the two from abusing her body (thinking with Zoro around, Sanji will be too busy fighting with him for him to concentrate on ogling her body). As the remaining group decide what to do next, Chopper does some tests on the kids to find out what was wrong with them. One of the kids,  Sind, collapses in pain. Two other giant kids do likewise. Chopper goes to Sind and asks what they would normally do at that time of day which Sind responds they would get a checkup then pieces of candy to which he would feel better afterwards.

Chopper confronts Brownbeard on what he knows, but the former pirate, being an outdoor patrol, has no clue and honestly believes that Caesar is trying to help the kids. Chopper disagrees, showing that what he found in the kids' bodies was  NHC10, a stimulant drug, that is only used by selected  doctors around the world (of which was Dr.  Kureha, which is why Chopper knows about it) but it highly addictive in larger dose. He surmises that the kids have been given the drug in the form of candy to keep them from running. When Luffy suggests getting the candy, Chopper refuses telling him that they cannot have the candy ever again. Sind begs Luffy to obtain some of the candy, but Luffy keeps to Chopper's orders. Sind suddenly start turning violent as if going into withdrawal, punching Luffy into a wall. When Usopp surmises that his strength is due to being a giant, the kids comment that Sind and the other kid were normal sized when they first came to the island, meaning they have been there the longest. From this Chopper deduces that the kids are being used for experiments.

As Sind and the other giant kids starts to rampage, Usopp keeps Luffy from attacking them and fires a sleeping star to stop them. With the crisis averted, Chopper begs Luffy to help save them to which Luffy agrees, though Franky rebukes them saying that it will not be easy. Robin also adding that they should get all the facts first before anything. Luffy decides to go look for Caesar while Chopper and Nami stay behind to look after the kids. To keep the giant ones from rampaging again, they tie them up with chains. Franky worries about getting their bodies back as well and that they need to find Law. Luffy jokes that it's fine the way it is prompting Nami to yell at him.

Meanwhile on the road towards the mountain leading to the research facility, we find that Zoro, Sanji, and Brook have been knocked out and giant footprints are leading away from them. Inside the research facility, Law has given Caesar Smoker's heart, much to his joy. Caesar mentions he sent soldiers the Marines' way. When asked about the Straw Hats, Caesar mentions the kids that are with them will want to come back, but, taking Monet's advice, decides not to underestimate them and dispatches two warriors who are dubbed the Killers of the Mountain: The  Yeti Cool Brothers, who are, at the moment, right outside the Straw Hats' hiding spot.

The brothers contact the guards to comes pick up Brook, Nami (Sanji), and Zoro claiming they have killed them before setting off after the others. Back in the main lab, Caesar has gotten word of this, Monet comments that defeating three of them felt too easy and asks Law if he knows them from two years ago. Caesar instantly accuses Law of calling them to the island, but Law states he only just found out when he ran into them at the front of the facility and would have warned Caesar otherwise. It goes into a flashback in which Law first arrived on the island and bargained to be Caesar's bodyguard in exchange for being allowed to roam free in the lab and not to tell anyone he was there, including Caesar's employer, Joker, Caesar accepted after Monet asked if he could heal the prisoners of the island. Back in the present Caesar apologizes for his outburst before Law asks about the kids. Caesar proves Chopper's theory by stating he gave them candy filled with gasses to get them to come back (to Law's disgust). Law then heads out telling Caesar and Monet to call if they need him.

Back at the Straw Hats' hiding spot, the area is being bombarded by explosions. Chopper (in Sanji's body) and (Nami in Franky's body) have been left behind with the kids as they stated before while Luffy, Robin, Usopp and Franky (in Chopper's body) have headed to the main lab. Chopper tries to spot the enemy but cannot tell where they are. Luffy's group hear the explosions and, seeing the giant footprints in the snow, head back to aid their friends. Prompted by Nami, Brownbeard reveals that their assailants are the Yeti Cool Brothers, two mercenaries who can appear and disappear in a flash and kill whatever target for the right price, even Brownbeard has not seen their faces only knowing they are covered in hair.

It is at that moment one of the brothers, Scotch, appears right in front of the group who did not even realize he was there till he spoke up. Scotch reveals that Brownbeard is on their kill list as well and proves it by playing a Den Den Mushi recording of Caesar giving the order dismissing him as expendable. Brownbeard breaks down crying in disbelief before Scotch shoots him point blank, presumably killing him. Luffy's group make it back, getting the brothers' attention. They fire on him, but Luffy dodges and makes to attack but before he can, he realizes they are gone, causing him to smack into the structure from his momentum.

Chopper runs up telling him that they took Nami. We find she indeed has been captured by the pair due to orders from Caesar (mostly for the Vegapunk designs on Franky's body) and that they can now kill everyone as they wish. Meanwhile in the backdoor of the facility, a guard encounters Law as he leaves the facility. When asked why he is there, Law states he will do as he pleases, leaving the sliced-up body of Caesar's defeated guard behind him.

Back in the Straw Hats' hiding spot, Luffy arrives and sees Brownbeard's injured body. Chopper informs him that two mysterious figures came and attacked them, and also took Nami in Franky's Body. Luffy decides to set out, but before he does, Franky in Chopper's body decides to go as well and asks Chopper for one of the "beans" he uses to transform. Chopper gives him one of the  Rumble Balls and tells him only to use it in emergency, but before he finishes his sentence, Franky transforms into  and goes into a rampage. Luffy heads out and is oblivious to the fact that Franky has gone berserk, as he instructs him to follow him.

Meanwhile in Caesar's Lab, Caesar remarks on his surprise to find out that Franky had Vegapunk's weapons and says he cannot wait to cut him open. Caesar then tells his underlings not to provoke the Marines, and to just let them take refuge, because he has a plan.

Meanwhile, behind the laboratory, Nami is screaming for the Yeti Cool Brothers to let her go, exclaiming that they will be sorry when Luffy gets there. The Brothers then explain how they have poison gas in their rifles, and how Nami's friends are going to have to follow the footprints to find them. Luffy then stumbles upon the footprints, and dodges Franky's incoming attacks. Luffy jumps off the cliff, and before being stabbed by the icicles, Luffy uses  Busoshoku (Armament) Haki to destroy the spikes from it. When Rock fires upon Luffy, the young captain says that  Rayleigh taught him that just reflecting bullets was sloppy, and that instead he should bounce back the bullets with twice the power with the technique . This injures Rock, but Franky continues to attack Luffy, and the Yeti Cool Brothers notice the conflict between the two and try to take advantage of it. The Brothers explain their special  KYP gas bullets that cause others to become drunk in an instant, and that this is what they did to Zoro, Brook, and Sanji. The Brothers drop a glacier from the sky, but it is grabbed by Franky at the last second and hurled at Rock incapacitating him. Franky then resumes attacking Luffy, but Luffy disables him with .

Suddenly Law shows up, and at first is greeted by Scotch, but then Law bifurcates him, unleashes his  ability and quickly defeats Scotch. Law begins explaining to Luffy about an "important key" that is stored on Punk Hazard that could throw the  New World into chaos. He then asks Luffy to form an alliance with him, and that he has a plan to depose one of the  Four Emperors.

#### A Sudden Ally and a Sudden Threat: The Warlord of the Sea and the Slime[]

Nami (still in Franky's body) insists that Luffy has nothing to do with Law. Luffy accepts the offer, after Law tells him who their target is. When they go back to the rest of the crew and explain, Usopp and Chopper are fervently against it, while Robin simply agrees but warns Luffy that there is a chance that Law may betray them. When Luffy questions Law if he would, Law replies no. Luffy then proudly states that even if Law is not a "good guy," Luffy trusts his crew and their strength, shamelessly flattering them into agreeing. Law then returns Chopper and Franky's "hearts" to their bodies, while Nami's is shifted to Sanji's (much to her dismay) since her body was not present. Robin is glad that Franky is out of Chopper, while Chopper is angry at Luffy and Franky (who were blaming each other) for causing such damage to his body.

Law explains how the children were test subjects to make giants, most likely for armies, and that the project initially started with the World Government. Law's obligations suddenly increase when Luffy entreats the Warlord of the Sea for help with both the children and Kin'emon since some of his crew want to help them. At this point, Usopp chimes in and explains to Law that Luffy's view of an alliance is different from other people's. Exasperated Law agrees to help with the children, but they have to take care of the samurai themselves. When he asked for the Straw Hats doctor to come with him, Law was mortified when Usopp tied Chopper to his hat, while the rest of the crew laughs. Chopper is then tied to his  nodachi instead. Law begins to explain about Caesar's potential threat and why he wants to eliminate everyone who has come to this island. He then goes on to note that only  Haki users should go up against Caesar, to which Luffy replies that it left Law, Zoro, Sanji and himself. Law then continued to explain that the plan involved kidnapping Caesar and warns Luffy that once it is set in motion, they will not be able to stop, and when Luffy said that it's fine, Law requests he has to convince the rest of his crew.

Meanwhile at the G-5's location, the Marines were engaged in battle against the transformed and supposedly dead former prisoners. With Smoker and Tashigi unsure of what is going on, the Marines continue to fight. Elsewhere, in Vegapunk's intact lab, a Den Den Mushi is continually ringing, which Caesar continues to ignore, knowing that it is his minions requesting help. Caesar then laughs as he decides to release his "pet" on his "visitors". In the Fire Lands, two centaurs run for their lives after opening a "door" on Caesar's orders. They desperately try to make contact as they are being chased by a giant monstrosity.  Smiley, also known as Slime, then releases a cloud of what appears to be poisonous gas that seems to suffocate the centaurs.

Meanwhile, Zoro, Sanji and Brook have awakened and continue with their search for the samurai, though Zoro and Brook have gotten bumps on their heads and the three argue on what attacked them. The story flashes back to an hour earlier when they had begun their search when they spotted giant footprints in the ground thinking they belong to a snowman. They followed the trail leading them to a cliff. However, it was an ambush by the Yeti Cool Brothers who had shot them with gas that caused them to become drunk. The brothers then shot the cliff causing the three to plunge to a lower cliff filled with icicle spikes. Zoro managed to remain awake long enough to cut the cliff in half for them to fall safely before passing out in midair. When Caesar's guards came to collect the bodies, Sanji managed to awaken first and defeat their captives despite being in Nami's body. He then kicked Zoro and Brook awake to continue their search.

Having told the samurai that his torso was near the lake, Brook and the others head there to look for him. They find him after unknowingly stepping on his body freezing in the snow. After waking him up, the samurai comments that he felt as if his torso had fallen into the water which caused him to freeze up. The three Straw Hats agree to go into the lake to retrieve it. When asked why pirates are going to all the trouble to help him, Sanji comments he just felt it as their responsibility and that when he gets his body back, they will have a fight. Grateful the samurai thanks them before they spot figures coming toward them revealed to be the  Centaur Patrol Unit they fought earlier running from something, even ignoring the group in their retreat. Zoro realizes they are running from the direction from the lake but also points out a giant shadow in the distance.

In Caesar's lab, Caesar is telling Monet how the slime came to be; a byproduct of the accident that happened four years ago. Rather than purify the gas like he told his subordinates, Caesar had compressed the poisonous gas and turned it into a monster to be used for his whims. Meanwhile at the lab's front door, the G-5 unit is still battling Caesar's guards, successfully managing to capture a ship. However, Tashigi is trying to get a handle on Smoker's ability which is causing smoke over the area and the group cannot get the lab door open to Smoker's annoyance. At the back of Caesar's lab, Law and Chopper have arrived via Law's abilities. Law states he will lure out Caesar and Monet allowing Chopper to examine the drugs. Chopper asks why he cannot deal with the two himself, though Law does not fully answer his question. Just as he is about to head inside, the two hear a yell.

Smoker's unit does too as a figure rushes toward their area revealed to be Luffy with Franky clinging to him. They crash into and through the boat before re-emerging while Robin, who had jumped off at the last second, flies down via her hand wings  ability. Luffy yells for Caesar to come out much to Law's surprise as he did not want Luffy to take on Smoker's and Caesar's groups.

Some of Caesar's men attack Luffy, Robin and Franky but Franky easily takes them out while Luffy wonders where Caesar could be. Tashigi confronts Luffy, demanding to know what he is plotting but Luffy easily dodges her smoke attack and pins her down using Haki wondering why "Smoker" got so weak. Smoker, seeing this, attacks Luffy from behind to Luffy's surprise that "Tashigi" got much stronger. Robin then points out that their bodies were switched, causing Luffy to laugh when he realizes who "Tashigi" is. He tells Smoker he will hold off their fight until he gets his body back, much to Smoker's chagrin. Franky meanwhile manages to blast the lab door open.

Just as Luffy's group is about to head in, some of the slime suddenly lands on the ship the G-5 Marines have acquired. Both sides are bewildered on what the slime is. The G-5 men try attacking it, but it starts emitting toxic gas and the slime pieces suddenly merge together, making it bigger. One of the Marines suggest pushing it into the water and stupidly tries to do so but get sucked into the slime. His fellow comrades pull him out with the Marine yelling he cannot feel his face. As some of the Marines try to tend to him, another Marine comes up with a flame thrower and tries to burn the slime. It seems to work at first, but the slime suddenly explodes, destroying the ship and all the men on it to the shock of everyone on shore.

Caesar's men are relieved at first in that the slime destroyed itself but more pieces of it suddenly appear on the mainland. Both Caesar's and Smoker's men panic and try to get out of the way of the raining slime. Caesar suddenly appears, gloating that the slime will take care of all of them. Because it does not like water, it is throwing itself piece by piece to their area to avoid the lake. Indeed, where Zoro's group is, the slime is spitting itself over the lake, much to the confusion of the group. Caesar continues to gloat but as he starts to explain himself, Luffy suddenly tackles him.

Back with Zoro's group, Brook claims that he read a book about slime being creatures that can melt the clothes off women, much to Sanji and Kin'emon's interests. Zoro chides them otherwise, noticing that the slime that falls into the lake is killing the fish. Realizing that the lake will be contaminated if this continues, Sanji volunteers to go into the lake despite the freezing temperature to go retrieve the samurai's torso. Leaving Zoro and Brook to deal with the slime that are heading for them.

Back at the main lab, Law has gotten inside to find only Monet by herself. He tells her he is thinking of departing and needs her  ability to help with something, which she accepts. As they exit the room, Chopper, who was hidden in a bag, watches them go. Outside, Luffy begins his fight against Caesar by trying to use his  move enhanced with Busoshoku Haki. Caesar dodges and tries to use poisonous smoke on Luffy, but Luffy is unaffected, due to his  poison  immunity he gained from his battle against  Magellan. He hits Caesar knocking him to the ground. But as he tries to follow it up, Caesar uses a castanet to send out explosive gas. Luffy is caught in the blast and starts to fall to which Caesar calls for his slimes to grab him. They converge on Luffy which, along with Caesar's castanet, causes an even bigger explosion.

For a second it seems like Luffy was caught in that blast as well, but he appears behind Caesar having managed to escape in time. He then hits Caesar with a  attack which seems to finish off the scientist. He calls for Franky and Robin on if they got anything to put him in but just as Franky starts to look, Luffy starts coughing then doubles over before falling unconscious. Caesar recovers, claiming Luffy underestimated him. Meanwhile back inside, Law similarly doubles over in pain and collapses to the floor. He sees footsteps coming toward him and recognizes the figure, asking what he is doing on the island. The person greets Law stating he has grown up since he last saw him.

#### More Secrets Revealed: Joker's Identity and Shinokuni[]

The man,  Vergo, tells Law that "they" do not trust Caesar and have sent Monet in as a deep cover agent to monitor him, revealing that he arrived on an inbound  SAD tanker from  Dressrosa. Law tries to attack him, but Vergo uses his power on a bamboo stick he is carrying and easily beats Law down.

Back outside, Caesar has beaten both Franky and Robin as well as Smoker and Tashigi, much to the distress of the remaining G-5 crew as they note that Caesar did not touch them. Caesar orders his men to tie up the five and that he will take care of the slime falling from the sky. Back up at the lake, Zoro and Brook have had no luck trying to combat the slime when the samurai suddenly doubles over in pain. In the water Sanji finds the samurai's body in the mouth of a shark which was causing the samurai pain. He pulls it free when the shark tries to attack again only to get caught in the poison from the slime in the water. Despite knowing it will strain Nami's body, Sanji uses  to get himself out of the water before the poison closes in on him.

Returning to shore, Sanji finally completes the samurai's body. The samurai introduces himself as Kin'emon of Foxfire and he thanks the three for getting him back to normal, claiming him in their debt (to Sanji's annoyance). However, the four find themselves surrounded by the slime and trapped. Kin'emon steps up, claiming he is called "Firefox" for the fact his sword slashes and burns. He swings on the slime causing it to catch fire and explode. However, the four are unharmed as Kin'emon explains he used a secret technique to cut the explosion. Impressed, Zoro requests to come along to rescue his son.

Elsewhere, on an unnamed island, the children's parents' plea desperately to the  Marine Commodore  Yarisugi, who denies their claims and tells them their children are dead. The parents hope that Vergo, who is revealed to be a vice admiral, can help them.

Back on Punk Hazard, Usopp and Nami are having trouble keeping the kids controlled. The side effects of withdrawal make them seem zombie-like, and Usopp cannot put them back to sleep. Suddenly, Caesar appears, and promises the kids the candy they crave.

Meanwhile, Zoro, Sanji, Brook and Kin'emon continue to run from the slime. The slime reveals itself to be a Devil Fruit  Zoan user, and has eaten the  Sara Sara no Mi, Model: Axolotl. It is also revealed the slime's name is Smiley.

At Caesar's lab, Monet is talking to Vergo, and says he must have missed a spot when wiping his face, since there is an almost whole hamburger patty on his cheek. Luffy, Franky, Robin, Law, Smoker, and Tashigi are all captured in a cage, and Robin asks if it feels nostalgic, because Luffy and Smoker were locked up together in  Arabasta as well. Vergo reveals himself to be not only a vice admiral, but also an underling of Joker. Luffy then asks Law who Joker is, and Law reveals him to be Donquixote Doflamingo, and also states he used to be an underling of him.

Back at Nami and Usopp's hideout, Caesar has found their hiding spot and goads the kids, who are under the withdraw symptoms, to come with him. Nami and Usopp try to fight him off with Usopp even trying to blow him up with a . However, Caesar reveals that his Devil Fruit ability allow him to remove the oxygen in the air which is how he defeated Luffy and the others in the earlier fight. What is more the pair have to contend against the giant children who are now hallucinating them as cockroaches. Eventually Usopp and Nami are defeated and about to be killed by the kids when Brownbeard suddenly awakens and saves the pair, having survived the Yeti Cool Brothers attack. This allows Usopp and Nami to awaken and go after the children while Brownbeard fights Caesar off.

Brownbeard declares he will save his crew from Caesar's lies, though Caesar taunts him as a failure of a New World  Captain before defeating him with his  attack, blowing him up. He then catches up with Usopp and Nami and swiftly defeats them too before retrieving the children and heading back to the lab. As he does, he broadcasts to all the  Underworld  brokers and cites his intention to do an "experiment" on all his captured subjects as a demonstration of his weapon. Among the people watching are  Big Mom's crew and Captain Kid's who proclaims he is not interested in the weapon but curious as to what is going on.

Back in front of Caesar's Lab, the G-5 marines notice Caesar's  Flying Gas Balloon. The kids get out of the balloon, and they ask for candy. Caesar tells them to go into the Biscuits Room to receive the candy. Caesar then tells his men to lock the door as soon as the kids get inside.  Mocha then has a moment of lucidity, realizes that she has betrayed the Straw Hats, and starts to beat down the door, while calling for Nami. Back in the cave, Nami and Usopp wake up.

Meanwhile, in Caesar's Lab, Caesar enters and starts to converse with Vergo. He tells Vergo that the experiment will begin shortly, and to start the video. Caesar then starts to insult Law, calling him a weakling. It is then shown that Law, using his Ope Ope no Mi, gave his heart to Caesar in order to gain his trust, and that Monet had to give her heart to Law. Vergo is then revealed to have Law's heart, which is why he was able to defeat him so easily. Vergo squeezes Law's heart, and Law cries out in pain. Caesar then reveals that he has Smoker's heart as well before Monet alerts Caesar that the video is ready.

In the  Ice Lands, a giant piece of candy has been placed on the ground. The underworld brokers continue to watch the broadcast. Caesar starts to narrate what Smiley will be doing and explains how he killed the island four years ago. Caesar reveals that Smiley is the H2S bomb in the flesh. Caesar reveals the name of the weapon to be  Shinokuni.

Meanwhile, Zoro's group continue to run from Smiley, and also notice the giant piece of candy. Caesar's men confirm with Caesar that Smiley has finally reached the Ice Lands. Caesar tells his men to evacuate and take off their protective suits as soon as they are done. Suddenly, Vegapunk's dragon runs away, and with the escape sled. Caesar acts worried, but Monet points out that he is a bad actor. Caesar tells Smiley he cannot eat the candy just yet, but Smiley eats it anyways. Caesar calls Smiley a good boy, but Monet tells him that Smiley was not listening to him.

After Smiley eats the candy, a reaction builds up inside of it and it begins acting weird. Outside Zoro's group and the centaurs and trying to get away as fast for they can from the creature, with the former noting how desperate the latter is running away from it. Smiley suddenly lets out a roar and begins to dissolve, while on the abandoned sled, one of the fruits suddenly bears the markings of a Devil Fruit. Caesar notes that Smiley died and hopes they meet again. Soon the blob dissolves into gas and begins to spread. One of the centaurs is caught in it and is suddenly petrified.

Caesar begins to celebrate and comments that before his gas weapon could only paralyze the victim but left them alive. However, he created a new type of gas that turned the victim's body to ash and paralyzed them completely. As the brokers continue to watch Caesar's men getting paralyzed, Smoker's men likewise see the effects on the video and notice the gas heading straight for them. Zoro's group is barely able to outrun the gas but notice the dragon that was with the centaurs. The four make for it in hopes of grabbing on and getting clear of the gas.

Luffy sees Zoro's group on screen which gets Caesar's attention, claiming that the gas will get them sooner or later. He then has the cage the prisoners are in taken outside by a crane, citing that he wishes to prove that his weapon is tougher than any high  bounty pirate, Marine vice admiral or Warlord of the Sea. Chopper, seeing this from his hiding spot, starts panicking and wonders what to do. However, a piece of paper suddenly falls on him which turns out to be a note telling him "Don't Do Anything" to his confusion on who threw it. The captives' prison box is hung outside which the Marines notice as well as their captain's within it, pleading for the two to help them. Despite the incoming death, Luffy, Robin and Franky are rather nonchalant about the situation. Law then tells Luffy that it is time to make their move for a counterattack.

#### Commence the Counterattack!: Pirates and Marines vs. Caesar Clown and Vergo[]

The brokers in the New World continue to observe the experiment, surprised that Caesar managed to capture so many renowned individuals. Amongst them are Kid and  Killer, who themselves have planned an alliance with  Apoo and Hawkins. However, Apoo and Kid quickly start arguing and Hawkins makes to leave. Killer tells the three that they need to be willing to discuss with one another neutrally if they even hope to have an alliance.

On Punk Hazard, Law begins setting their counterattack into motion. He asks Franky to burn a nearby ship to creating a smokescreen, then reveals that he had swapped some of the  Seastone chains in the laboratory with normal ones, allowing him to break free. He switches Smoker and Tashigi back into their original bodies, demanding their cooperation in return for their lives. Tashigi, embarrassed as her top is unbuttoned, quickly agrees which Smoker admonishes her for begging. Tashigi retorts that some things are more important than pride while also commenting on the consequences if they were to die there. Seeing no choice, Smoker reluctantly agrees to the condition. Law teleports his group into the lab and opens the shutter door to let the G-5 Marines enter the facility much to the shock of Caesar's underlings who find the captured prisoners now freed.

Outside, the rest of the Straw Hats and Kin'emon continue to flee from Shinokuni. Sanji, Zoro, Brook and Kin'emon catch up to the dragon, while Usopp and Nami ride on Brownbeard. The groups manage to join with one another and make it to the lab, but the shutter door begins to close with them still outside. Kin'emon and Zoro cut through the iron shutters allowing Brownbeard to burst through. All of them reach the laboratory at the same time. Luffy notes that everyone is present and is ready to begin the counterstrike.

The G-5 Marines berate Zoro and Kin'emon for creating a hole in the shutters that the gas can get into it. Meanwhile, Brook uses his astral form to observe the outside of the base and informs them that it is impossible to go outside without dying. The G-5 Marines repair the hole with boards and metal, then attempt to arrest Zoro, Brook, Usopp, Kin'emon, Nami (In Sanji's body), Sanji (in Nami's body) and Brownbeard. They are interrupted by Luffy, who asks if they are ready to start. Nami then asks Law if he can switch her back into her own body, along with Sanji (Sanji is obviously not happy about this) and Law agrees. Nami punches Sanji for peeping on her body by changing coats (in truth he had taken it off to dive into the lake to retrieve Kin'emon's upper body). Sanji notices he feels weaker which Usopp notes was from getting blown up by Caesar's explosive gas.

Law then requests everybody's attention and tells them that to escape the laboratory they need to find a door with "R Building 66" on it. He gives them two hours and says after that he will do something to the base to make it unsafe. They then all split up. Kin'emon says he needs to rescue his son, and Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Brook, and Usopp go along with him. Smoker orders the G-5 Marines to rescue the abducted children, look for the "R Building 66" door and that they will seize the tanker at the harbor. Luffy goes alone to defeat Caesar, and Robin stays with Law, most likely to look for the door. Smoker goes to confront Vergo and tells Tashigi to go look after the G-5 who are chasing the Straw Hats, and to help everyone escape. Meanwhile, Usopp and Zoro exchange their stories of defeat by Caesar and the Yeti Cool Brothers respectively. Zoro cites they need to be more careful, warning that he is not joking and yells to Luffy "The New World starts here." Luffy says he will not be careless, and unveils a new technique, , to defeat a group of Caesar's subordinates as everybody makes their way further into the lab.

Meanwhile Caesar, Vergo and Monet are watching the effects of the gas on the monitor. While Caesar is pleased with the results, he notices his prisoners nor the G-5 Marines were caught in the gas. Vergo takes it to mean that they escaped and sure enough one of Caesar's men report this to the group. Chopper, who was listening, heads down the hall relieved that Luffy and the others are alright. He notes the paper that was thrown to him has an escape route. He mentions he also found out how the candy was made and found a sedative for it as well. However, his departure does not go unnoticed by Monet.

Caesar realizes the group is heading for Gate #66 in Building R. He orders the passageway between buildings A and B be sealed off, then to blow hole in the sealed part to let the gas in though wishes for the Den Den Mushi to continue running to show the brokers his scientific work. Vergo, knowing he will be in trouble if Law and Smoker escape, heads out to stop them himself.

Luffy is already headlong into Building A, knocking away the guards who come against him. He reaches the connecting passageway just as an alarm starts to go off. Law and Smoker arrive shortly after with Law realizing what Caesar is up to. At the lab entrance, the G-5 Marines ignore Law's warning and try to arrest the Straw Hats. Brook, Zoro and Kin'emon attack them to get them out of the way. Usopp, Sanji and Nami (later joined by Robin who stayed with them on Luffy's orders) are still on Brownbeard who rushes past the marines. Brownbeard notes the dragon that was with them and ponders why they brought it along with Sanji explaining they had used it to escape the gas, but it does not seem to fly now as it is sedated. Nami, oddly enough, finds it rather cute.

The Marines continue their assault, but just as Zoro is about to strike them. Tashigi jumps in and block his attack. Begrudgingly allowing Zoro to pass her as she tells her men they have other concerns at the moment with the building's gate closing. The Marines agree and everyone rushes for the gate. Just as they do, a cannon from outside the building fires and hits the wall, letting the gas in. Everyone makes a mad dash and jumps through the gate. Brownbeard, the Straw Hat Pirates and some of the G-5 soldiers make it through as well as Tashigi. However, it is revealed she was thrown by a few of her subordinates who were lingering behind. Tashigi tries to go back to rescue them but is told it is too late. One of the fellow Marines compliments those that could not make it on saving their Captain. As the gate closes, they see that the men caught in the gas giving thumbs up poses as they were frozen much to Tashigi's dismay and sorrow for their sacrifice while the Straw Hats stare disgusted over what occurred.

Caesar monitors this, angry he did not dispose of his intended targets. He vows that he will not let anyone escape. The Straw Hat Pirates and Kin'emon are now all riding on Brownbeard's back now (to his annoyance) plow on ahead while the Marines tailing behind. As they continue to press forward, the marines are attacked by the dragon from before, only now it's much more feral and dangerous. However, it suddenly flies off in the midst of its assault and Vergo suddenly appears. The Marines are happy to see him at first thinking he is leading reinforcements. Tashigi, having seen firsthand that he is a traitor, warns them to get away from him. Vergo lays waste to the Marines, much to their confusion. Tashigi tries to attack him, but he easily dispatches her, forcing Sanji to double back and come to her aid. The dragon soon targets Brownbeard and the Straw Hats. Meanwhile, Caesar plans to destroy Building B and allow the gas in, which would also kill Vergo. Luffy and Smoker, having reached Caesar at last, break in the door and Luffy assaults Caesar with a -enhanced punch, saying that he will not let Caesar escape again.

#### The Creeping Danger: Save the Kids and Outrun the Killer Gas[]

As Caesar reels from the punch, Smoker remembers that before Law freed him, he ordered Smoker not to touch Caesar since he still has his heart. As Smoker leaves to go find Vergo, Luffy begins the second round of their battle as Caesar recovers from the sudden attack. Caesar demands to know why Luffy is trying to capture him to which he explains his role in Law's plan. Caesar admonishes him, warning Law cannot be trusted but Luffy retorts that it is for him to decide. The two clash with Luffy landing a few solid hits. Caesar tries to suck the oxygen out of his enemy's surroundings, but Luffy manages to get out of range of the vacuum and attacks from a distance. Caesar reveals he has other methods of attack such as a flaming sword. Luffy manages to avoid the blade and prepares to finish him with a . However, Monet uses her Devil Fruit power to create a snow wall and protect Caesar. On her suggestion, Caesar abandons the battle and leaves hoping to locate Law, though promises he has a method to make guinea pigs out of Luffy and his friends.

Luffy tries to pursue him, but Monet gets in his way, claiming "Joker" will kill her if something happens to Caesar prompting Luffy to question Doflamingo's motivations. At the passage connecting A and B buildings, Sanji and Vergo begin fighting where Vergo cracked Sanji's bones during a connected attack. As the two continue, Sanji yells for the Marines to run as the room begins to go into lockdown and the gas is let in from the previous locked room. An emergency broadcast is heard from the D Building that Law is in the manufacture room of the  SAD room much to the panic of Caesar and Vergo, with the latter stating it was what Law was after ever since he became a Warlord of the Sea and that whatever he is planning will make a mess of the New World.

As Law approaches the SAD tanker menacingly, the gate in the A and B passage closes to the horror of Tashigi and her subordinates who worry for Sanji. However, he appears from above, alive and well, and even managed to save some Marines who could not make it through the gate. When asked about his leg, Sanji brushes off the question though in his mind he realizes he would have been in real trouble if he had continued fighting Vergo. Sanji questions the troops about him which Tashigi states he is no longer their superior before ordering the soldiers to search for the children.

In the B Block, Vergo is revealed to have also escaped the gas and is now conversing with Doflamingo who is on the island, Dressrosa. After being informed of Law's betrayal, Doflamingo orders Vergo to destroy the SAD room and extinguish Law with extreme prejudice. All the while, a woman in a maid outfit known as  Baby 5 tries to assassinate him with a variety of weapons that come out of her arms. Another subordinate knocks her away before Doflamingo uses his power to halt her attack. He closes the transmission telling Vergo, Monet and Caesar to be vigilant of Luffy since he wields  Haoshoku (Conqueror's) Haki, that he will be sending Baby 5 and  Buffalo as support and for everyone to return to Dressrosa when they have completed their missions.

In another section of Block B, Brownbeard is trying his best to avoid the dragon that's chasing them as it spreads flames through the building. Nami, Usopp and Robin managed to weaken it with their attacks. When it attacks again, Kin'emon  cuts through the flame blast before Brook and he defeat it together with sword strikes. However, Brook notices that Kin'emon seems to have a personal vendetta against the dragon as if he wanted revenge, which Kin'emon claims is not too far off. As Brownbeard plows forward, the Straw Hats notice Chopper on a balcony above them but now in  and does now seem to be in control of himself. What is more he is fighting against some of the giant children to the bewilderment of his crew mates. In the second floor of Block B, a girl is finishing her examination and is told to go back into the Biscuits Room. However, she asks about a child that went into the "Forbidden Room" and suddenly came back out a dragon, the girl naming the child as Momonosuke. One of the men tells her that Momonosuke is somewhere else, in a treatment room and requests her to keep it quiet.

Meanwhile, Monet seals Luffy in a ten-layered snow hut. Luffy says that Monet cannot defeat him in a battle, to which she agrees but states that there are other ways to win without having to rely on her fighting powers. She then suddenly hugs him and begins to weaken him with her powers, attempting to coax him into unconsciousness. Luffy, however, simply blasts through the floor with a  and falls into the basement. Taken by surprise, Monet tells him that unless he can fly, there is no way out of the basement.

In Building B, Chopper in his  is trying to block the berserk children from the Biscuits Room, telling them that they must not eat the candy. However, Chopper is unable to fight without hurting the children and is beaten down before the Rumble Ball wears off. At this point, Brook, Kin'emon, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Robin come to the rescue, and Chopper informs them that he is trying to prevent the children from getting their candy with the assistance of Mocha, who is trying to protect the candy. Robin then uses her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to stop the children from entering the room. However, the children simply beat the giant hands down and rush to obtain the candy. Mocha tries to tell them that the candy is bad for them, and that they need to listen to Chopper. When she tries to flee to the exit, Monet suddenly appears, blocking the exit with a snow barrier. Monet then tells Mocha not to keep the candy all to herself and that she should share the candy with the other children.

In the SAD Room, Vergo shows up which Law attempts to use his Devil Fruit ability to retrieve his heart, but Vergo steals it back from him and brutally beats him to the ground by using his heart to immobilize the Warlord of the Sea. Law manages to hit Vergo with a , but the attack is ineffective on Vergo. Vergo informs Law of the message from Doflamingo, "what a shame." Law then tells Vergo that he is the one miscalculation in his plan. Vergo then prepares to execute Law, but Smoker suddenly appears. Vergo says that he will kill Smoker, no matter what methods it takes, to which Smoker answers that they should finish the battle quickly, as he does not like looking at trash.

Smoker and Vergo begin their battle with Smoker getting angry when he hears that Vergo harmed his subordinates. In the B-Block G-5 side, Sanji, Tashigi and her squad try to catch up with the others. But due to the fire from the dragon encountered earlier, the tanks in the building explode, damaging the walls and letting the gas in. A few of Tashigi's men are caught in it, prompting Sanji to usher the remaining soldiers ahead. In the R Block on the secret floor, Caesar is monitoring this while assembling his men in the room. Caesar states that he does not like this room, as the room was originally Vegapunk's old control room.

Caesar forms a plan to usher the intruders into the R room's first floor then open the shutters to the C and D room trapping them on all sides with the gas. He rallies his men with a false account of how Vegapunk was malicious in his experiments, and he is trying to show that his gas has the power to be used for good. However, he is deceiving to them, and he reminisces in his mind during his days collaborating with Vegapunk trying to convince him of the gas and giant solider experiments, believing Vegapunk as well as  Sengoku are soft for not attempting them. Eventually Vegapunk decided to dismiss him from the science council for such reckless experiments and ordered him to leave the facility. Caesar retaliates by detonating his bomb which led to the decimation of the island, ending the flashback.

#### An Icy Harpy and a Tiny Dragon[]

While Sanji and Tashigi's group are fleeing from the gas, Zoro's group fought against Monet, and Smoker battled against Vergo all on the B Building. Only Luffy was unaccounted for as he was still in the C Building Garbage Disposal which he fell into. As he explores the underground area, he comes across yet another dragon and inquires who the dragon is. Surprisingly, the dragon can actually speak, likewise asks who he is.

The dragon identifies himself as Momonosuke and soon both Luffy and he get acquainted before he tells Luffy how his situation came to be. Unlike many of the kids there, he actually stowed away aboard the ship that was abducting kids from their homes and taken to Punk Hazard. The kids all acted friendly with him, however, due to his samurai upbringing, he shrugged off any help that was given to him, promptly starving himself for ten days. Eventually he reached his limit and explored around the lab, finding Caesar's control room or the "forbidden room" and an  Artificial Devil Fruit in a glass case. He promptly busted it open and scarfed down the Fruit before he was discovered by the girl who had asked about him earlier. The two talked where she mentioned her desire to return to their parents. Caesar's men discovered the room was open and proceeded inside prompting the two kids to run. However, the fruit's power activated in Momonosuke and turned him into his dragon form. He managed to scamper away before Caesar's men knew what happened.

Luffy mentions that since he is a Zoan, he could change back to normal though he does not know how the process works. Momonosuke also mentions that he had overheard Caesar telling his underling Monet of how the giant experiment was unstable and that the kids will die in five years if they continue being experimented on. Naturally, Caesar did not care about the kids' fates and planned to abduct a new group of kids to continue onward deeming it an "unavoidable sacrifice." Momonosuke had tried to warn the other kids but wound up in the garbage disposal by accident. Hearing this angers Luffy and he vows to get out and help the kids. However, Momonosuke collapses from hunger, Luffy tries to rouse him which somehow triggers a hallucination of Doflamingo in Momonosuke's mind. He has suddenly taken to the air heading upwards with Luffy clinging onto him as they leave the waste disposal.

In the B Block Inspection room, Usopp, Kin'emon and Brook have split off from the group to find some Seastone handcuffs at the request of Robin, using Brook's  spectral powers to help them. In the SAD room, Law recovers as Smoker and Vergo continue to duel to the death. Near the Biscuits Room, Tashigi and the G-5 Marines are still evading Shinokuni with Sanji taking the rear and kicking any stragglers ahead so no one will be caught in the gas. Finally in the Biscuit Room, Zoro's group has its hands full trying to stop the berserk children and fighting Monet. Robin is wounded by Monet, while she is trying to prevent the berserk children from attacking Mocha, prompting Zoro to engage Monet himself, ordering his crew mates to subdue the kids. With only twenty minutes left before the gas fills the whole B Block, Monet and Zoro continue their battle while Robin assures Nami and Chopper that she is fine.

As Mocha continues to run from the berserk children, she has a flashback to Caesar lying to her and the kids' parents about their "illness" and how he had a son who also died from it, which is why Caesar wanted to heal the children. As she remembers her friend, Mocha pleads to the berserk children to go back to their normal dispositions.

Meanwhile in the Biscuits Room, Monet attempts to attack Nami and Chopper, but Zoro blocks her attack and Nami responds with a , damaging Monet. Robin, Nami and Chopper attempt to stop the children again, but Monet blocks the exit out of the Biscuits Room with a snow barrier. Monet then transforms into a terrifying, demonic like snow woman, capturing Chopper and Nami in her body and nearly biting into the two. Robin uses her Hana Hana no Mi abilities to make arms on Nami's hips and shatters Monet apart.

Zoro then cuts down the snow barrier, allowing Robin, Nami and Chopper to escape from the Biscuits Room and to chase after the children. As Zoro and Monet continue to clash, Monet points out Zoro has only been blocking her attacks and not countering. Before she can act on this, Sanji with the G-5 Marines and Tashigi arrives at the Biscuits Room. Zoro and Sanji comically insult each other while the Marines then compliment on Monet's beauty at which she blushes at and even hiding her blush with her wings and buckling her legs. However, a suddenly enraged Monet then transforms in her monster form and attacks the Marines, biting a Marine's shoulder off. Tashigi counterattacks with a Haki imbued attack, injuring one of Monet's wings. She tells Zoro they managed to seal the room's entrance but know it will not hold for long. Tashigi orders her troops to find the kids while she declares that she will stay behind in the room and fight Monet.

Sanji assures the G-5 men that, while he will not hurt women, Zoro is a different story entirely, but Tashigi and he will be fine as they continue to look for the kids. He boosts the Marines morale, claiming that they will get praised by Tashigi, Nami and Robin if they accomplish their goal. Meanwhile Zoro gets mad at Tashigi claiming that she is getting in his way, but Tashigi claims that, in addition to stopping Monet from going after her subordinates, she is staying behind because Zoro will not cut a woman basing her assertion on their first duel back in  Loguetown. Zoro denies it but claims since Tashigi wants to fight Monet, sits down and permits Tashigi to have the battle. Thinking she assumed Zoro's "weakness," Monet becomes conceited and attacks Tashigi with a barrage of snow attacks. Eventually managing to wound Tashigi with a bite to the shoulder though Tashigi endures it as she knows she will lose her arm if she pulls back.

Just when it seems Monet will finish her. Zoro cuts Monet in the cheek with Busoshoku Haki, causing her to let go of Tashigi. Asking if the two women are satisfied and chiding Tashigi for being too slow, he approaches Monet admitting that there are things he will not cut before asking if she has ever met a wild animal that is guaranteed not to bite. Monet realizes he actually  going to attack her but is frozen in fear from his gaze to move. Zoro indeed cuts her in half but does not use Haki, thus she survives thanks to her  Logia powers. However, Monet is still too terrified from fear to pull herself back together properly. One half of Monet's body manages to get up and attempts to stab Zoro in the back. However, Tashigi interferes and finishes her off, finally defeating the snow harpy.

Afterward Tashigi chides Zoro, rebuffing his claims that she had interfered in the fight before he had a chance to cut Monet. Zoro brushes her off, telling her she can have credit for beating Monet much to her chagrin. The gas begins to seep in and, due to her wounds, Zoro is forced to carry Tashigi to catch up with the others, to which Tashigi is outraged at. She then tells Zoro to let her off when they reach her subordinates. However, she is distracted by Zoro's sword,  Shusui and gets excited at seeing it, but Zoro is annoyed at it and tells her to stop it. Meanwhile, Chopper, Nami and Robin are doing their best to keep the berserk children from catching up to Mocha by having Chopper sedating them one at a time. Despite their efforts, Mocha finds herself cornered by a group of children who managed to get around the Straw Hat Pirates and the children attempts to forcibly get the candy from Mocha. Having no choice, Mocha puts the entire batch of candy in her mouth. Despite Chopper's pleas, she swallows the entire contents. The story goes into a flashback a few moments earlier as Chopper and Mocha were trying to barricade the door to the Biscuits Room.

Chopper explains to Mocha about Caesar's deception and using the kids for his experiments and how if Caesar continues to use them, the children will die before they reach adulthood. Mocha remembers her friends promising to each other that when they get older, they will reunite and go on an adventure. The gravity of the situation becomes clear to Mocha, but Chopper promises that he and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates will save her. Mocha vows not to let any of the kids get the candy and runs off to guard the room just as the children burst in. Back in the present, Mocha begins coughing up blood, due to the serious overdose of the drug. The other children stop upon seeing her condition and unsure what to do now. As Chopper, Nami and Robin rush to Mocha, Sanji and the G-5 Marines finally arrive and begin subduing and sedating the kids. The Marines have Mocha moved to an examination room, to which Chopper is grateful for, complimenting Mocha on her bravery and hoping that he can save her.

Meanwhile Luffy and Momonosuke emerge from a garbage chute in front of some of Caesar's men, with Momonosuke passed out and now being carried by Luffy. Luffy grabs one of the guards and demands to know where Caesar is. The guard tells Luffy that Caesar is in Building R, to which Luffy immediately sets off for Caesar's location.

#### Punk Hazard Crumbles: The Downfall of Caesar Clown and Vergo[]

Brownbeard is then seen on the first floor of Building R, screaming at the door stating that he will tell his men Caesar's true colors. Caesar decides to go down to the first floor in order to deal with him. Brownbeard demands that Caesar give him back his men as Caesar asks what is wrong. A flashback occurs showing that Caesar left Brownbeard's men to die outside. Caesar states he has no idea where they are. Caesar's men begin to question Brownbeard about what he is doing, and then he reveals to them that Caesar called them guinea pigs for his experiment, but before he is able to do this, Caesar injects him with a muscle relaxant, which prevents Brownbeard from moving and slurs his speech. Caesar then quietly reveals to Brownbeard that he abandoned his men outside, and that him, their savior, was the one who caused the explosion that almost killed everyone four years ago. Brownbeard then attempts to attack Caesar, but Caesar dodges and orders his minions to shoot him.

Suddenly, Luffy comes through the room and grazes Caesar with a . Luffy then stands in front of Brownbeard in order to protect him and remembers the kind words Brownbeard said about Caesar before. Caesar then orders his men to go back to the second floor, and Momonosuke recognizes Caesar as the one who experimented on the children. Luffy then questions Caesar as to what Punk Hazard really is, and Caesar reveals it to be the home of the underworld, where experiments take place, people die, and nobody will know.

He tells Luffy that he knows nothing of the island and explains to him how futile everything he has done so far is, and reveals that the SAD is actually used to make artificial Zoan Devil Fruits called SMILEs. He tells Luffy that the Emperor was using these fruits in order to build a mighty army. Caesar then tells Luffy that he is protected by these strong people, and that a person of his level will not be able to take them on at all. Angered at the scientist, Luffy punches Caesar, breaking his nose in the process, telling him that he has taken on guys like this many times; and the two begin the third and final round of their battle. Caesar warns Luffy again about just who he is dealing with before trying to attack Luffy again with , a gas burner attack. However, Luffy dodges and punches Caesar again. Meanwhile, Shinokuni is filling Building B, as the children run for the exit, along with Zoro and Tashigi.

In the SAD production room, Vergo defeats Smoker, though it is revealed that Smoker was only acting as a diversion so Law could retrieve his heart without resistance. Law then warns Doflamingo, who's been listening the whole time via the Den Den Mushi, that he cannot stay on top forever and that he is going to defeat Vergo, but Doflamingo tells him otherwise recounting an earlier instance where Law mouthed off to Vergo who gave him a beating that apparently traumatized Law. Just as Vergo covers himself in Busoshoku Haki and prepares to eradicate his former associate, Law bifurcates the Vice Admiral in half, as well as the entire island, asserting that he has destroyed the gears of the New World.

Due to Law's attack however, the gas begins to flood into the building. Zoro and Tashigi manage to meet up with Nami's group and the G-5 Marines. Chopper finishes treating Mocha and has her moved as well. In the SAD room, Law has sliced up Vergo and hung his pieces along the railing. Vergo swears Law will regret this as he does not know of Doflamingo's past and tries to get Smoker to tell him the truth of the world. Nonetheless Law slices his head in half and taunts him before bidding "Pirate Vergo" farewell.

On the first floor of Building R, Caesar sees the damage to his base and is quite upset over it. He orders his men to flood the room so the Shinokuni will power him. When they protest that over 100 of his minions are still in the room, Caesar finally drops the facade, yelling how they are all his guinea pigs, and he does not care how many of them have to perish. The men are aghast at this outburst while Usopp, who was hiding, watches from one of the monitors. However, a few of Caesar's men still remain in denial about Caesar's declaration, thinking it part of his plan against Luffy and open the vents. The gas flood in and Caesar begins to grow, ranting manically how a success his experiment was since two peaceful countries want to procure the gas and how he will become the king of the land of death.

He then attacks his own minions with the Shinokuni, which Luffy becomes visibly enraged and appalled. He instructs Momonosuke to stay with Brownbeard, he heads down a passage which Caesar takes as him fleeing in cowardice. In the control room, Caesar's former subordinates are dismayed from realizing they have been deceived and betrayed. Usopp makes himself known, demanding the use of the panel to assist his friends. The underlings taunt Usopp thinking his captain ran away but Usopp counters that Luffy is not one to surrender, no matter how hopeless the situation is and that in the end, even if Usopp wanted to run away, Luffy trusts his crewmates and that they are more than happy to return his fidelity. He goes on to state people like Caesar make Luffy angry and he will not stop until they pay. As he finishes this retort, Luffy is revealed to actually have gone down a corridor to gain running distance. He uses , infusing Busoshoku Haki into his arms, and rushes directly at Caesar as both combatants prepare for a final clash.

Caesar realizes he cannot win and tries to bargain with Luffy, stating he can become his subordinate. But Luffy hits him full force with his attack, the , knocking Caesar through the wall and down a passageway leading outside. The brokers who are watching this are astonished by Caesar's defeat. Some even start putting in calls to their bosses about what happened, including  Pekoms and  Tamago. Meanwhile Usopp effortlessly defeats Caesar's men and manages to contact Chopper and leads his group toward his area. As they head in that direction, they meet up with a distressed Brook carrying a petrified Kin'emon. He explains when they were freeing some of the kids, the girl Momonosuke talked with, told the samurai about what happened to him. Believing the dragon, they killed to be his son, Kin'emon tried to rush back to the area, hoping his willpower will get him through, which is how he ended up in the petrified state.

On the second floor of the R Block, we find that Usopp has defeated Caesar's men, chastising them for attacking him for no reason. Nami's group meet up with Luffy's as does Zoro's and Sanji's. With the whole building now filled with gas, only Gate 66 of the R Block is the only means of exit. Smoker and Law arrive near a truck meant to transport SAD which Law intends to use for everyone to escape. However, when told of what happened to Caesar by Luffy, an irritated Law sets off after him. Meanwhile a few moments earlier outside, Baby 5 and Buffalo have arrived via Buffalo's  Guru Guru no Mi ability which he uses to make himself into a makeshift bi-plane.

Baby 5 and he talk, it's revealed that she has the power of the  Buki Buki no Mi, and that her earlier assault on Doflamingo was due to him destroying a city due to a guy she liked and that he constantly does this every time she takes an interest in someone. Buffalo also mentions how gullible she can be sometimes such as agreeing to fifty newspaper subscriptions, giving back more money that she borrowed, even paying for others shopping of which she has racked up a massive debt. The two reach Punk Hazard, with Buffalo using his spinning power to blow away the gas, just in time to see Caesar come flying out of the building and hit the nearby tanker.

They call Doflamingo who quickly orders Caesar to be retrieved, stating as long as he has him, SAD can still be produced. Baby 5 and Buffalo go to do so but notice something else on the tanker, a robot, which is revealed to be the  General Franky, who likewise notices the two above him. Franky opens fire upon the pair, hitting Buffalo. Baby 5 returns fire with her gatling gun, but Franky is unharmed by the attack and instead throws his shield at them. Baby 5 transforms into a sword, and Buffalo cuts the shield in half with her. Baby 5 turns into a missile and is propelled towards Franky, creating a huge explosion. Caesar, meanwhile, wakes up and realizes with glee that he still has Smoker's heart.

Back in Building R, the Straw Hats are waiting for their remaining friends to arrive before leaving the island. When Brook, Chopper, Kin'emon, and Mocha finally arrive, everyone piles into the railcart to get away from Shinokuni. Elsewhere in the facility, Monet, still conscious, calls Doflamingo, who tells her to detonate a weapon that would destroy the entire island and leave only Caesar alive.

#### Aftermath of the Incident: Fulfilling a Promise and Delivering an Ultimatum[]

Back on the tanker outside, Baby 5 reassembles herself from her bomb attack. But Franky was unaffected, and immediately continues to battle. Caesar notices they have come to rescue him and decides to eliminate Smoker with the heart that was given to him by Law. In the SAD Production Room, which is coming down, Doflamingo calls Vergo, apologizing to him and thanking him for his hard work which Vergo oddly smiles at. On the trolley, Momonosuke cries at his father's state. However, before Luffy can comfort him, an explosion rocks the building which Law notes came from the SAD room. Debris starts threatening to fall on the escapees and in front of the track which Luffy, Zoro and Sanji manage to knock aside.

In Building C, Monet feels it too but knows it will not be enough to destroy the island. She readies to hit the ignition switch, saying a silent goodbye to Doflamingo. At that point Caesar stabs the heart, but Smoker is not affected, and instead, Monet collapses and dies. Smoker inquires to Law why Caesar thought he had his heart, and a flashback reveals that Caesar had forgotten he had given Law Monet's heart as insurance they would not betray each other. After Law had defeated Smoker, he simply gave Caesar Monet's heart, who thought he gave him Smoker's heart. The trolley soon reaches the exit.

Meanwhile the  Donquixote Pirates have noticed that he has departed from Dressrosa and is flying across the ocean heading toward Punk Hazard having grown concerned when Monet did not answer his call. Upon realizing that Baby 5 and Buffalo are still alive, and the island still stands, he tells the pair that he will be there shortly.

Back on the island, Franky continues to battle Baby 5 and Buffalo. The latter manage to damage the General Franky with Baby's 5's scythe form. But he responds by firing a mobile version of the , the , at the two. This manages to blow them away, but they recover albeit heavily wounded, in the process mentioning they were after Caesar who, Franky noticed for the first time, was on the tanker. The lab escapees finally reach outside where Law identifies the Donquixote Pirate members. When questioned by Luffy if they were his friends, Law coldly states the two are his enemies.

Seeing themselves outmatched, Buffalo and Baby 5 retrieve Caesar and attempt to make a quick retreat. Law prepares to stop them only for Nami and Usopp to offer to do it themselves. Nami creates an enormous thunder cloud above the pair which shocks them with a lightning strike. The attack knocks out Baby 5, however Buffalo and Caesar are still conscious but knocked out of the sky. Caesar pleads with Buffalo to protect him. However multiple projectiles fired by Usopp quickly take him out. Caesar tries to escape alone but the last projectile turned out to be Seastone handcuffs which quickly negate Caesar's abilities and render him unconscious. With this the Donquixote members are defeated and fall into the ocean. Law proclaims the first step of his agenda has been completed.

Meanwhile out on the ocean, a mysterious figure awakens, muttering to himself that he is headed for Punk Hazard. Back on the island, everything settles down and the group get to work on recovering. The Marines draw a line in the ground to separate the pirates from the Marines though Luffy ignores this to converse with Brownbeard who is decided to give himself up so he can receive treatment from Caesar's poisons. Caesar, Buffalo and Baby 5 have been fished out of the water and chained up. Franky and some of the Marines begin fixing the tanker which was damaged during the battle. Though a bit of panic sets in when Brook accidentally drops Kin'emon, thinking he has killed him. However, this only breaks the shell covering him and he revives from his petrified state much to the surprise of everyone. Momonosuke, who somehow managed to switch to human form, greets him happy he is alive. Chopper meanwhile confronts Law thinking he is harming the kids but turns out he was operating on them to get the poison out of their systems and they're fine. They question Chopper if Mocha will be okay as she still has not woken up, but he confirms that she will be fine.

Tashigi comes by to take overlooking after the kids and sending them home which turned out to be a request from Nami. When questioned by Usopp why, she tells him the reason is because her being a pirate would only complicate matters if she attempts doing so herself to which he agrees, also mentioning she feels safe around female Marines due to the fact her foster mother,  Bell-mère, was one. Meanwhile Sanji has fixed a stew which he got from the  Kamabakka Kingdom. He serves Momonosuke first as he had heard he had not eaten in days. The boy is reluctant at first, but Kin'emon, grateful to Sanji, convinces him it's alright. Soon the kids, the Marines and what left of Caesar's former subordinates all gather around to eat. Law tries to convince Luffy that they will need to move but he instead throws a party to his bewilderment.

As everyone enjoys themselves, a few of Smoker's men tell him that they got the "killer" gases weakness out of Caesar and are going back into the island to rescue their comrades. Law comes over to which Smoker comments he is amazed Law kept his word, though wonders what he is using the Straw Hats for. Law queries he wonders who's using who, as he thinks back to when he made the alliance with Luffy in order to defeat  Kaidou. A flashback then occurs to the event. When Law reveals he is after Kaidou, Luffy accepts, saying his goal is to defeat all the Emperors (as long as the one is someone other than  Shanks). Law claims that their goals coincide, but Luffy shouldn't underestimate them, for even with his plan and their alliance, their chances in defeating Kaidou are only about 30%. However, Luffy accepts his offer regardless of the disadvantage.

Back to the present, Law tells Smoker that he is planning on heading to  Green Bit with the Straw Hat Pirates. The children are getting ready to leave the island on the tanker with the Marines. The Marines then draw up a line and tell the pirates not to cross the line, as they are pirates and therefore, a stain on humankind. The Marines continues to insult the pirates, and Nami tells Chopper that Vegapunk is going to help permanently cure the side effects of the poisoned candy. As the Marines keep scorning the pirates, the children want to express gratitude to the pirates for helping them but cannot because the Marines are trying to prevent the children from doing so. Tashigi then angrily yells at them to stop harassing the kids, saying that "it is disgraceful." The Marines explain why they are deriding the pirates; if they do not, then they will admire and respect the Straw Hats, despite the fact they are pirates much to Smoker's annoyance and Tashigi's amusement.

Meanwhile, Doflamingo is crossing the sea, as he notices a raft. The raft holds the decapitated heads of Baby 5 and Buffalo (having being cut off using Law's ability) as well as a Den Den Mushi. Baby 5 and Buffalo apologize for their failure in retrieving Caesar Clown, but Doflamingo tells them to relax, as they were doing as he ordered. The Den Den Mushi then speaks up, revealing to be from Law. Law tells Doflamingo that he has Caesar, and it is time to conduct business.

Doflamingo laughs and tells him that he does not do business with kids and warns Law not to mess with him. Law ignores the threat and tells him that he should be more worried about Kaidou, Doflamingo's prime trading partner. If Kaidou learns that Doflamingo cannot produce any more Smiles, then he will have to suffer the consequences. A terrified Doflamingo panics and asks what Law wants in exchange for Caesar, to which Law tells him to resign from the Warlord title before the next day's newspapers' release. Law mockingly states that this will mean the  admirals from Marine Headquarters will then be free to hunt him down like every other pirate. He then goes on to say if the next day's newspapers have the news of Doflamingo's renunciation of his title, Law shall contact him again, but if the newspapers do not have the report, then Doflamingo best take care of himself. He then drops the call, leaving Doflamingo enraged.

Back on Punk Hazard, some of the G-5 Marines put on the protective suits and head into the island to retrieve their friends, revealing that the suits were meant to shield from the gas, and Caesar, knowing this, had tricked his subordinates into taking them off. However, the gas is still a danger as those frozen are still inhaling the poison and will still die if not cured in time. Smoker is then seen talking to Brownbeard and allows him to go into the gas to retrieve his men, though warns that he intends to arrest them. He and his group then come across the headless bodies of Baby 5 and Buffalo, and the Marines are not sure what to do with them. However, the Marines see two objects flying towards them which is revealed to be Baby 5 and Buffalo's heads which land roughly back on their bodies. But what is even more shocking, Doflamingo flies down, enraged.

He quickly displays that he has Haoshoku Haki, knocking out the majority of the forces and attacks the rest using some kind of invisible string, demanding to know where the Straw Hat Pirates and Law are. Smoker refuses to give up their location and lies, knowing that Doflamingo will not let him live anyway, he further provokes the Warlord of the Sea referring to him by his underground alias name, Joker. Doflamingo comments on him knowing too much and then attacks him. Meanwhile on the ocean, the Thousand Sunny is sailing down a " Sea Slope" away from the island. Brook asks about the Mini Merry II to which Franky explains he had found a sea passage away from the research laboratory and moved the ship to go pick it up. It is then revealed that the group is heading for Dressrosa as per Law's plan which Kin'emon seems to already be familiar with.

Luffy informs the rest of the crew about the alliance he formed with  Law's crew and his intention of dethroning the Emperor. Also with them is Caesar who they have dragged along who continues making threats against them. Law explains that the Four Emperors have spheres of influence all over the New World but are underground so as not to attract the Marines' attention. One of their most trustworthy brokers is Doflamingo who uses the alias Joker so no one will suspect him. He is also the biggest supplier to Kaidou of the Artificial Devil Fruits, SMILEs, which is why Law wanted Caesar kidnapped and destroyed the drug SAD to decrease Kaidou's battle power. Their objective now is to get to Dressrosa and destroy the factory where the SMILEs are being manufactured to cripple Kaidou further. Kin'emon also wishes to head to the island as a friend of his is being incarcerated there.

Back on Punk Hazard, Smoker has been beaten and about to be killed by Doflamingo who says he will find the Straw Hat Pirates and Law without his help. Just as he is about to strike the killing blow, Kuzan suddenly shows up and halts him, stating that Smoker is his friend.

Despite Kuzan's presence, Doflamingo continues with his attempt to kill Smoker anyway but is quickly frozen by Kuzan's  Devil Fruit ability. However, he manages to break free. Seeing nothing to gain from engaging Kuzan, Doflamingo takes his leave, but not before questioning Kuzan what he stands for due to rumors he had heard. Kuzan does not answer him and calls for a medic. Doflamingo collects Baby 5 and Buffalo and departs. Only then does Kuzan state that even though he is not enlisted in the Marines anymore, he never completely trusted the World Government and that he can still make a difference outside the Marines. Smoker inquiries about how he knew of Punk Hazard as it's top secret, worrying that he's doing business with the criminal underworld, but Kuzan tells him he has not changed. He also warns Smoker to advise Sakazuki to keep an eye on Doflamingo as he poses the biggest threat to the Marines and also requests the G-5 Marines promise not to reveal he was there.

Out on the sea, the crew is taking a breather. Usopp and Chopper worry furiously about Doflamingo coming to attack them. Kin'emon nearly gets into a duel with  Zoro thinking he had robbed  Ryuma's grave due to him having his sword, the Shusui, on him. Momonosuke is revealed to be taking a shower with Robin much to the envious anger of Sanji, Brook and Kin'emon. When they confront him over it, Nami punches all three for their supposed bullying. Gaining their ire even more when he uses his childish nature to get Nami to hug him (and giving the three a rather lecherous look in the process). As the night goes on, most of the crew (Luffy, Zoro, Brook, Nami, Robin, Law, Caesar and Momonosuke) sleep while others (Usopp, Chopper, Franky, Sanji, and Kin'emon) stay up looking after the Sunny.

Morning comes and a  News Coo delivers the paper which indeed reads that Doflamingo abdicated his position as a Warlord of the Sea as per Law's demands as well as his royalty of Dressrosa. However, there is also a picture of Luffy and Law and an article stating their alliance much to the crew's surprise. Also in the paper is news regarding  Kid,  On Air and  Hawkins Pirates  alliance as well, though Law is unconcerned with it. He then explains his next phase of his agenda to the crew.

On Dressrosa, the people of the island are confused and in an uproar over the news of their king's sudden resignation while Doflamingo is in his office reading. Law's Den Den Mushi rings which he then answers.

### __Dressrosa Arc__

#### Arrival at Dressrosa: Adventure in the Country of Love, Passion, and Toys[]

After  Doflamingo resigned as a  Warlord, islands across the world fell into chaos as they prepared to lose the support of his  Underworld businesses. At the new  Marine Headquarters,  Brannew talked about the potential instability created by Doflamingo's resignation and  Law's possible expulsion from the Warlords of the Sea, and  Sakazuki responded that he had sent  Fujitora to deal with  Luffy and Law's alliance.

Doflamingo called the  Straw Hats and Law, and Law arranged to return  Caesar Clown at 3 PM on  Green Bit. During the call, Doflamingo hinted to Luffy that he had something that the Straw Hat would like to get. Afterwards, Law revealed that Caesar's return would be a cover for their planned destruction of the  SMILE Factory in  Dressrosa, the location of which remained unknown. The alliance then ate, and  Kin'emon revealed that his comrade  Kanjuro had been captured while helping him leave Dressrosa to go after  Momonosuke, and he wanted to rescue Kanjuro while in Dressrosa.

In Dressrosa, the  Donquixote Pirates were lounging as the citizens were still in a panic over Doflamingo's abdication of his throne. Inside the palace, Doflamingo spoke to his three executives  Trebol,  Pica, and  Diamante, unveiling the  Mera Mera no Mi which he entrusted to Diamante in order to lure Luffy into a trap in the  Corrida Colosseum.

The Straw Hats and their allies made it to Dressrosa, and disembarked as they went over the plan. Law,  Usopp, and  Robin planned to take Caesar to Green Bit, and Law gave the  Thousand Sunny protection team a  Vivre Card to get to  Zou, where his crew was. The protection team consisted of  Nami,  Chopper,  Brook, Momonosuke, and  Sanji, although Sanji had gone into town with the Factory Destruction and Samurai Rescue Team. They gazed at the bustling streets, where humans coexisted alongside living  toys. There were also passionate dancers that romanced men before stabbing them. The team then went to a restaurant, and Sanji noted that everyone seemed calm despite Doflamingo's abdication. The team then spotted a blind man being swindled at a roulette wheel by some of the Donquixote Pirates, and Luffy went to expose their deception. The  pirates attacked Luffy, but the blind man responded by unleashing a crushing force that sent the pirates plummeting into a hole. The blind man then left the restaurant, and Luffy asked who he was, but the man responded that it was better for both their sakes that he doesn't answer.

Soon afterwards,  Zoro noticed that  Shusui was missing as the citizens noted that the "fairies" had come to pickpocket some things. Unwilling to accept the loss of his sword, Zoro spotted it and chased after the fairy, and Sanji and Kin'emon pursued him. Luffy chased after him as well, but  Franky held him back, having gotten the idea to get information about the  SMILE Factory. They interrogated one of the pirates that the blind man had attacked in the alley, but he claimed no knowledge of the Factory's whereabouts. He said the higher-ranking members who knew would be gathered in the Corrida Colosseum today, as a tournament was being held with the Mera Mera no Mi as the prize. People had come from all over the world to win it but would have to face the Donquixote Pirates'  Machvise,  Dellinger,  Lao G, and  Senor Pink as well as the "Hero of the Colosseum," Diamante. Luffy wanted to get  Ace's  Devil Fruit for himself, and Franky encouraged him to do so as they headed for the Colosseum.

#### Corrida Colosseum: The Battle for Mera Mera no Mi Begins[]

The duo approached the Colosseum, where they saw the one-legged toy  Thunder Soldier being chased by police. The soldier went into the Colosseum, which authorities were barred from entering, before going to talk to Luffy and Franky. Luffy entered in the Colosseum, where he donned the nickname, "Lucy." As he mingled with all the other gladiators, he was confronted by a man named  Spartan, who thought he was a weakling and tried forcing him out. However, Luffy responded by flipping Spartan over and defeating him. The authorities nearly expelled Luffy afterwards, but  Sai,  Boo, and Don  Chinjao of the  Chinjao Family intervened, explaining that Luffy was acting in self-defense. Luffy then went to try on some armor, but put on too much, and as he took it off, he met the pirate  Cavendish. Luffy nearly revealed his real name to Cavendish, who revealed that he held a grudge against the members of the  Worst Generation for stealing his fame. Luffy then looked at a statue of a gladiator named Kyros, and the gladiator  Rebecca revealed that Kyros had supposedly gone 3,000 battles without being defeated, although no one knew who he was. She revealed that she intended to win the Mera Mera no Mi and take down Doflamingo, and having taken a liking to Luffy, she wished for them to meet in the second round. Right then, the A Block battle finished after having just started, and the winner took off the paper bag on his head to reveal that he was  Jesus Burgess.

After the A Block battle, Franky went to continue the mission to locate the SMILE Factory, and Thunder Soldier tagged along with him. The blind man also departed from the Colosseum and was revealed to be the  Marine  Admiral Fujitora. Fujitora prepared to go to Green Bit, and also wanted to look into the amount of people on Dressrosa in case any innocents were injured. Inside the Colosseum, an undercover Marine listed the wanted pirates present to  Vice Admiral  Maynard, who was undercover as the contestant "Capman." Maynard was then approached by  Gambia of the  Barto Club, and easily took down the pirate. As the B Block battle was about to begin, however, Gambia's captain  Bartolomeo defeated Maynard as he headed for the arena.

Bartolomeo was greeted with boos from the crowd, but also in B Block was the popular  Bellamy, who had given Doflamingo a gold pillar in a declaration of loyalty and winning this tournament would grant him officer status in the Donquixote Pirates. As Bellamy headed to the arena, he first approached Luffy, having recognized him. Bellamy said that his goal was to join Doflamingo and that he no longer had enmity toward Luffy before walking away. The B Block battle then began, and the strategist  Dagama formed an alliance to protect  Elizabello II, the king of the  Prodence Kingdom. As he was protected, Elizabello warmed up his "," a punch strong enough to blast through a fortress.

Bellamy took on  Tank Lepanto, the commander of Dressrosa's army, and the former  bounty hunters  Abdullah and  Jeet, the  Fish-Man  Hack, the  Longleg  Blue Gilly, and the mysterious fighter  Ricky emerged as strong contenders as well. One man in the audience found Ricky's fighting style to be familiar, and as the fighting raged on and gladiators were sent falling into fighting-fish infested waters, Bartolomeo lay on the edge of the ring, relaxed. As Luffy and Cavendish watched the battle, Chinjao suddenly came up to them, exposing Luffy's real identity as he revealed that he had a grudge against  Garp, which he wished to carry out on his descendants as well. Cavendish wished to kill Luffy as well, and the three got into a brief scuffle before Sai and Boo stopped their grandfather to prevent his disqualification. Cavendish wanted to continue attacking Luffy, but Luffy hid by hanging off a ledge.

The number of fighters in B Block went down to 30 as some top fighters began to fall. In the midst of this, Bartolomeo urinated off the side of the arena, and was confronted by Hack. However, Hack broke his hand on a mysterious force and fell to the ground, defeated. Dagama and Blue Gilly then broke the formation around Elizabello as they betrayed the people in it, but Blue Gilly took down Dagama as well. Bellamy was struggling against Bartolomeo when Elizabello prepared to unleash his , and he threw it, unleashing a monstrous force that was felt in the entire arena. As the dust settled, only Bartolomeo remained, having created a barrier to block the punch with the  Bari Bari no Mi. Bartolomeo then crashed his barrier into Elizabello, defeating him and winning B Block. Afterwards, Bellamy spoke with Luffy while he was being carried away on a stretcher, and Bartolomeo overheard Bellamy saying Luffy's name.

#### Green Bit: The Exchange Meeting Commences[]

In a northeastern cafe, the Caesar Return Team looked at the bridge to Green Bit; even though it was made of iron, the waters nearby were surrounded by fighting fish and no one who had gone across the bridge recently had ever returned. Law planned to head to Green Bit regardless and expressed concern about the peaceful climate around the island when Robin suddenly noticed agents of  CP0, the strongest  Cipher Pol agency, walking past; she said that nothing good happened when they were around. The team then ventured across the bridge, with Usopp, Robin, and Caesar defending against the fighting fish while Law saved his energy for the return journey. They then came to a chasm in the bridge, where they saw a fighting fish being caught in a net by an unseen group of people. They forced Caesar to fly them the rest of the way to Green Bit, and once they reached it, they noticed a Marine ship that crashed into the island. Law had Robin and Usopp scout out the island's heavy forestation while he prepared to hand over Caesar to Doflamingo.

Sanji caught up to Zoro as he was chasing the fairy, when he noticed a beautiful woman named  Violet dancing onstage. Zoro ran off while he was distracted, and as Sanji looked around, Violet suddenly came up to him and asked him to hold her. She kissed him as the police raced by looking for her, and Sanji was overcome with passion. Violet said that she was being chased for stabbing a man, and asked Sanji to accompany her to the next town and also to help her kill a man. As they traveled, a sniper tried to shoot them, but Sanji flew up and defeated him. However, Violet later attacked Sanji as she revealed herself to be an assassin for the Donquixote Pirates. She prepared to look into Sanji's mind to find out the Straw Hats' purpose on Dressrosa, but was repulsed by his lecherous thoughts. Sanji stated that he knew Violet was telling the truth when she asked him to kill a man for her, believing that she did not really want to be with Doflamingo. Taken aback, Violet took down her crewmates with whale-shaped tears before telling Sanji to run. By letting him glimpse into her mind, she revealed that Doflamingo never resigned his Warlord title or abdicated his throne, which CP0 had revealed to the citizens earlier. She told him to get his crew off the island, and Sanji contacted Law about Doflamingo's deception. However, it was too late, as Doflamingo and a group of Marines led by Fujitora confronted Law on the coast of Green Bit.

Inside the Green Bit Forest, Robin and Usopp overheard an exchange between a group of Marines and an unseen people. The Marines refused to hand over their weapons and were stripped. Robin then caught one of the people with her hands, realizing they were most likely  dwarves. She saw the dwarf she caught,  Kabu, but then the other dwarves knocked her and Usopp out with tranquilizer gas. They were split up, and when Usopp woke up, he claimed to be a descendant of  Mont Blanc Noland, a hero of the dwarves who had visited Green Bit 400 years ago. Robin woke up in the  Tontatta Kingdom, stitched to the ground with  Leo's  Nui Nui no Mi power as the dwarves of the  Tontatta Tribe searched her. She claimed to mean no harm, and the dwarves instantly believed her due to their gullibility. Leo introduced her to their king  Gancho, but told Robin they would need to take her weapons. Since she had no weapons, the dwarves prepared to strip her, but they were stopped by  Flapper, who revealed that Robin was Usopp's friend.

Robin appeared to Law, having heard Sanji's call, and she planned to go to the port with Usopp. Across the world, people received the news correcting the report about Doflamingo. Law wondered how Doflamingo was able to do something like this, saying that only  World Nobles should have this ability, but he recalled what  Vergo said on  Punk Hazard about Doflamingo's past. Law refused to hand over Caesar, and Fujitora asked him about the Straw Hats. Law could keep his Warlord status if they were his subordinates, but he stated that they were allies, causing Fujitora to revoke his status and send a meteor falling on him. Law, Doflamingo, and Fujitora protected themselves from the meteor, destroying the ground around them except their footholds as they prepared to battle.

Meanwhile, Kin'emon was confronted by some Donquixote Pirates who recognized him. Elsewhere, Zoro caught up to the fairy and grabbed Shusui on top of a building but was flung off the roof and was hit by a falling millstone. However, he spotted and caught the fairy who had stolen his sword. The fairy was actually  Wicca of the Tontatta, who told him to take her to her commander on the  Flower Hill. She revealed that she had seen the Donquixote Pirates go to attack the Sunny, and Zoro initially raced toward the Sunny, but with no ability to get there, he was forced to go along with Wicca to the Flower Field. As he ran, he discovered that Doflamingo's crew had been keeping tabs on them the entire time.

Inside the Colosseum corridor, Franky found out that Thunder Soldier had been planning to destroy the SMILE Factory as well with his comrades. However, the Soldier's first mission was to rescue the people working in it, and he offered to tell Franky about Dressrosa's history. The duo ran out of the Colosseum, and Rebecca spotted them as she yelled out to Thunder Soldier, saying she would win and that they would live together afterwards. As the C Block battle began in the Colosseum, Franky contacted Sanji about their status. Sanji saw Luffy fighting in the Colosseum, and Violet gave him a map to the SMILE Factory as her subordinates approached them, before running off and agreeing to reunite at the western port. Kin'emon then reunited with Sanji, asking him to take down the Donquixote Pirates pursuing him. Sanji did so, and Kin'emon asked him to accompany him to the Toy House where Kanjuro was being held; as mentioned by Violet, the Factory was located behind the Toy House. Sanji decided to wait, as Marines were crawling around the Colosseum. Led by Vice Admiral  Bastille, they were waiting for the gladiators to come out, but to Bastille's surprise, not a single one from A or B Block had done so.

#### C Block Commences: The Dark Secrets of the Colosseum[]

In the Corrida Colosseum, Ricky refused treatment for his injuries when he encountered Rebecca, who encouraged him to have them treated. Ricky recognized Rebecca, silently apologizing to her. Elsewhere, Bellamy received a second chance to become a Donquixote Pirates officer by assassinating Luffy, and Bartolomeo approached Cavendish, advising him to not go after Luffy. In the arena, the giant  Hajrudin was a dominant force whilst Luffy had tamed the ferocious  Fighting Bull, nicknaming it "Ucy". Ucy ran into Hajrudin, who smashed it to the ground, but Luffy responded by jumping up and knocking out the giant with a single punch. The Chinjao Family, the  Longarm  Ideo, the bounty hunter  Jean Ango, and the brothers  Kelly and  Bobby Funk also emerged as strong contenders, and Boo attacked the Funk Brothers, only for Bobby to wear Kelly like a jacket using the latter's  Jake Jake no Mi and pummel Boo. However, Sai avenged his brother as he defeated the Funk Brothers with his  Hasshoken technique. Meanwhile, Jean Ango stole Luffy's helmet while Chinjao charged at Luffy, and Jean stated that he was hunting everyone who had perpetrated the escape from  Level 6 of  Impel Down two years ago. However, Chinjao stared Jean Ango down, allowing Luffy to reclaim his helmet before Chinjao headbutted Jean out of the ring. Luffy and Chinjao then charged at each other, knocking out the clashing Sai and Ideo in the process, before meeting in a clash of  Haoshoku Haki that knocked everyone else out of the ring.

As Luffy and Chinjao fought, Chinjao began getting emotional as Luffy brought forth memories of his past. They traded blows, but Luffy managed to hit Chinjao with . Chinjao claimed that Luffy and the Worst Generation had no chance of conquering the  New World, and Luffy propelled himself into the air as Chinjao remembered his past. Thirty years ago, he stashed large amounts of treasure in the  Jewel Ice Sheet, which could only be broken by his pointed head. One day he confronted Garp, who smashed his pointed head flat and rendered him unable to access his treasure, leaving him with his grudge against Garp. Chinjao met Luffy in a final clash, and Luffy hit him in the head, causing it to become pointed again. Chinjao was defeated and fell, and his head caused the ring to split in half. Luffy won the C Block battle, and Burgess recognized him.

After the fight, Cavendish attacked Luffy while Bartolomeo cut the tongues of some people who were speaking ill of Luffy, as he had greatly admired the Straw Hat ever since seeing him at  Loguetown. Chinjao then approached Luffy, thanking him for restoring his head. Luffy ran when Chinjao's head broke the ground while bowing, and Rebecca pulled him away. As they headed off, Luffy ran into Burgess, who was speaking with  Blackbeard. Luffy told Blackbeard that he would win Ace's Devil Fruit before heading off to a food stand. Since he had no money, Rebecca bought lunch for Luffy and took him to the gladiators' cell to hide. As they sat, Luffy was suddenly grabbed by the gladiators inside the cell, and Rebecca attacked him. Luffy overpowered her, but forgave her because she bought him food. He met the convict gladiators inside the cell, who were forced to fight 1,000 Colosseum battles for standing up against Doflamingo. The fights had become more brutal and violent since Doflamingo took power, and as the Thunder Soldier aimed to take down Doflamingo, Rebecca wished to win the tournament and take down Doflamingo to protect the toy after he had protected her for so long.

Rebecca then headed out for the D Block battle, remembering her past with the Soldier. She had lived with her mother, but when the Donquixote Pirates took over Dressrosa, they went into hiding and her mother was killed. The Soldier brought Rebecca's mother to her and offered to protect her. Despite Rebecca initially refusing, the Soldier stayed by her side as she grew up, getting a house for her and even becoming wanted when saving her from being sold into  slavery. He also taught her how to fight, and Rebecca now wished to repay him as she entered the ring to the sound of booing from the crowd, who hated her for being descended from the former king Riku Doldo III. Cavendish silenced the crowd, telling them to get down and fight Rebecca themselves if they hated her. The D Block battle then began.

In the Tontatta Kingdom, Usopp and Robin ate with the dwarves, and Robin found out about Usopp's deception. The dwarves were overjoyed to have Usopp with them on the day they planned to take down Doflamingo, and asked Usopp to lead them on the front lines. In Dressrosa, Thunder Soldier told Franky that humans and toys were segregated at night, and they saw a toy who claimed to be the boyfriend of a woman named  Esta. The toy was diagnosed with "human sickness" and thrown into the scrap heap. Franky and the Soldier then met a toy dog named Onepoco, who revealed that he was once a human named  Milo and the woman and boy he was playing with were his wife and son. The son said he had no father, and Thunder Soldier revealed to Franky that all the toys were once humans who were transformed by a Devil Fruit user who came with him ten years ago, causing them to be forgotten by the people of Dressrosa. The Soldier said he would say more once he and Franky reached the Flower Hill. Back in the Tontatta Kingdom, Leo revealed to Usopp that the dwarves were going against Doflamingo to rescue their 500 comrades, including their princess  Mansherry, from captivity in the SMILE Factory, which was located underneath the Corrida Colosseum. The Tontattas, Usopp, and Robin then headed for Dressrosa in an underground tunnel on insect and fox steeds. Gancho talked to Robin and Usopp, revealing that the history between the dwarves and Donquixote Family actually went back 900 years.

Franky and Thunder Soldier arrived at a cave underneath the Flower Field, where Zoro was with some of the dwarves, who revealed that Usopp had come to lead them. After the rest of the Tontattas had arrived with Robin and Usopp, Thunder Soldier went over the plan to depose Doflamingo, and Usopp looked for a chance to run away. Outside, Zoro and Wicca went to help the Sunny team when they ran into Sanji and Kin'emon near the Colosseum. Zoro told the two what was happening, and Violet reappeared, revealing that the Sunny was under attack and heading for Green Bit. Sanji went to rescue the Sunny, leaving Kin'emon with the Vivre Card Violet gave him, and Zoro and Kin'emon looked for a way to break into the Colosseum and rescue Luffy. Sanji rode toward Green Bit with Violet, who revealed the high Marine presence around the coast of the island. In the Dressrosa royal palace,  Gladius of the Donquixote Pirates became enraged as he became more certain that Violet had betrayed them.

#### The Dark History of Dressrosa: Law Makes His Move[]

On the Sunny, the protection team played with Momonosuke when they suddenly heard noises coming from inside the ship. An attacking party led by  Giolla of the Donquixote Pirates attacked the ship to take it over and kidnap Momonosuke, and Giolla turned the team into living art with the  Ato Ato no Mi. The team escaped the Sunny, which Giolla turned into a piece of art as well. On Green Bit, Law was overwhelmed by Doflamingo and Fujitora, and wondered why Nami was not answering the  Den Den Mushi. The Sunny team tried attacking Giolla, but she continued overwhelming them with her art powers. Chopper then picked up Law's call, and Law told them to head to Green Bit to retrieve Caesar. Doflamingo told him to hand over Caesar's heart, revealing that he had trapped Luffy in the Colosseum. On the Sunny, Brook acted like he was on Giolla's side as the ship went to Green Bit, and Giolla put the others in a mural to suffocate them. However, when Brook got Giolla to restore his cane and violin, he defeated her in one cut and freed his crewmates.

On Green Bit, Law was defeated and Doflamingo took what he thought was Caesar's heart. The Warlord of the Sea then revealed to Law that 20 royal families founded the  World Government and 19 of them moved to  Mary Geoise 800 years ago; the  Donquixote Family was one of the 19, and the  Riku Family took over Dressrosa afterwards. On the Sunny, the Straw Hats attacked Giolla as they wondered why Law was giving Caesar back to them, and Giolla revealed Doflamingo's deception to them. Law heard Nami striking Giolla with a thunderbolt and revealed to Doflamingo that the heart he had was not Caesar's. In this confusion, Law teleported himself away, grabbed Caesar, and ran toward the bridge to Dressrosa. Seeing the Sunny, he planned to throw Caesar there from the bridge and keep Doflamingo distracted while the Straw Hats escaped. However, the Sunny team cried out as they came under attack by fighting fish, and Doflamingo noticed them as he flew toward the Sunny. As he prepared to attack, however, he was met in midair by Sanji.

Doflamingo quickly overpowered Sanji and immobilized him, but before he could deal the killing blow, Law used  to teleport him away. Law brought Sanji and Caesar to the Sunny, and told the Straw Hats to use his Vivre Card to take Caesar to Zou. The Sunny then came under attack by both Doflamingo and a floating Marine battleship commanded by Fujitora, who threw a meteor at the Sunny. Law redirected the meteor back at the battleship, and Sanji noted that he seemed to be giving Doflamingo an unusual amount of attention when their main goal was just to destroy the SMILE Factory. Law turned his attention to Doflamingo and told the Straw Hats to go where there were no clouds, as Doflamingo could not fly there with his  Ito Ito no Mi ability. The Sunny then escaped with  while Law took Giolla hostage and confronted Doflamingo on the bridge. There, he said that he was ending the alliance with the Straw Hats, as his main goal was to bring Doflamingo down to avenge what happened 13 years ago. Law let Giolla run off as he and Doflamingo started fighting again, and on Dressrosa, Violet headed for the palace.

Outside the Corrida Colosseum, Zoro and Kin'emon got Bartolomeo to get Luffy to come see them. In the arena, Rebecca did well as she dodged attacks and made people fall out of the ring to eliminate them without attacking. Elsewhere, Sai was put on a table for his injuries to be treated, only to be sent into a pit filled with broken toys alongside the other losers from B and C Blocks. There, Tank Lepanto wondered if Ricky was actually the former king of Dressrosa, Riku Doldo III, and Ricky confirmed this. The gladiators reflected on the increased conflict that happened after Doflamingo took power due to his Underworld operations, even though the name of Riku was now reviled. In Flower Hill, the dwarves told the Straw Hats about how the Riku Family liberated them after taking power 800 years ago, only for Doflamingo to come back and restore the Donquixote Family's subjugation. Thunder Soldier revealed that an incident ten years ago caused the people of Dressrosa to lose King Riku's trust and revile his family, saying that he wished to protect Rebecca because he was her real father.

Ten years ago, Dressrosa was poor but peaceful, and  Monet had begun working as a maid in the palace. One night, Doflamingo came up to King Riku and claimed the throne, offering to let Doldo buy back his kingdom for 10 billion. Rather than fight, Doldo decided to try collecting the money, although Doflamingo did not allow him to reveal his presence. The Royal Army went out to collect money from the citizens, and out of faith in their king, they gave all they had. However, Doflamingo took control of Doldo and some soldiers and forced them to attack their subjects, leaving them aghast at their king betraying their trust. Meanwhile, Monet let the Donquixote Pirates into the palace, and they captured the princess, Viola. As Doldo continued attacking his people, Doflamingo, Trebol, Pica, and Diamante came in and stopped him, as well as taking down the royal army. They claimed to be the saviors of Dressrosa, and were welcomed by the people. Doldo survived due to Viola promising to serve Doflamingo in exchange, and she took the name Violet. Some of the army, such as Tank Lepanto, joined Doflamingo. The dwarves quickly learned the truth once they became subjugated again, and had decided to move against Doflamingo today as a result of their despair after Doflamingo's false abdication that morning.

In the pit under the Colosseum, Sai was suddenly pulled up by Trebol, where he was turned into a toy and forced to follow the Donquixote Pirates' orders. This happened to all the gladiators except Chinjao and Doldo, who no longer remembered the others. Up above, the convict gladiators told Luffy that although Dressrosa appeared prosperous and peaceful at first, further exploration of it revealed a dark side hidden away. In Flower Hill, the Soldier stated that Doflamingo had created numerous tragedies by having anyone who went against him turned into toys, causing them to no longer be remembered. Outside the Colosseum, Bastille's Marines grew confused at the list of the criminals inside, as they no longer remembered who most of them were.

On the bridge, Law continued fighting Doflamingo, who received a call from Diamante about Viola betraying them. Doflamingo told him to send the Colosseum fighters to the SMILE Factory, leaving him solely responsible for the Colosseum. At the Colosseum, Luffy reunited with Zoro and Kin'emon, and they called the rest of the crew. Franky told everyone about the dwarves' plan, saying he could not leave them to lose against Doflamingo, and so Sanji decided to turn the Sunny team back to help the crew take down the Warlord of the Sea. At the coast, Fujitora headed for the town after hearing about a fight happening there. A ruckus rose near the Colosseum as Doflamingo and Law came into the town, with Doflamingo having overpowered Law. Doflamingo then shot Law three times with a gun, defeating him. Zoro and Kin'emon charged at Doflamingo, but Zoro was met by Fujitora, who sent him falling into a hole. Doflamingo attacked Kin'emon, and as the two swordsmen recovered, they discovered that the blind man they had met was an Admiral. Doflamingo and Fujitora then flew back to the palace with Law in tow.

#### Operation SOP: The Separate Plans of the Determined[]

Zoro and Kin'emon were pursued by Bastille's platoon, and as they ran, Zoro told Luffy to find a way out. Right then, the Sunny came under pursuit by the  Big Mom Pirates' ship, with Caesar revealing that they were looking for him because he owed  Big Mom money. The Sunny team decided it might be a good idea to continue toward Zou in order to keep Caesar and Momonosuke out of Doflamingo's hands, and leave the rest of the crew with the chance Law gave them to destroy the SMILE Factory. Luffy agreed to this, and also allowed the Sunny team to strike back against the Big Mom Pirates while he, Zoro, and Kin'emon went to rescue Law and take down Doflamingo.

As this happened, Bellamy had approached Luffy to carry out his assassination mission, only to be confronted by Dellinger, who revealed that Doflamingo believed he would fail again and so ordered him to be killed. Dellinger severely injured Bellamy, but was stopped by Bartolomeo, and forced to go with Lao G to the SMILE Factory. Bartolomeo said he would not let a comrade die without helping, and Luffy came running in looking for an exit. Bellamy said there was none and wished to leave as well to meet with Doflamingo. Bartolomeo agreed to win the Mera Mera no Mi for Luffy, but a mysterious man said he could not let that happen as he approached the three. Luffy recognized the man as his long-lost brother  Sabo, who was now the second in command of the  Revolutionary Army, and Sabo gave Luffy an escape route. Luffy cried nonstop as he, Zoro and Kin'emon headed for the palace in animal disguises, and inside the Colosseum, Sabo donned Luffy's Lucy disguise as he contacted  Koala, who was also in the Revolutionaries, as she moved around Dressrosa's underground while he sought to win the Mera Mera no Mi and inherit Ace's will.

In the Flower Hill, Thunder Soldier unveiled  Operation SOP, a plan to destroy Doflamingo's underground port and remove the Donquixote Pirates from power. First, however, they would need to knock out  Sugar, the person who had been turning people into toys with the  Hobi Hobi no Mi, in order to free the toys and restore people's memories of them, which would unleash chaos across Dressrosa. They headed to the port through an underground tunnel, and since Franky could not fit through it, he decided to enter through the Toy House and create a distraction. He took on the group led by Senor Pink at the East Door, and blew in the entrance with . Meanwhile, Usopp found out about the forces guarding the Toy House as his group reached the underground port. Thunder Soldier then left for the palace in order to assassinate Doflamingo once Operation SOP was completed, leaving Usopp with the mission to knock out Sugar. The dwarves revealed that Sugar was being protected by Trebol in the Executive Tower in the center of the port, when some Donquixote Pirates discovered Usopp. As they confronted him, the dwarves stripped them before Leo and  Rampo knocked them out, and Usopp and Robin donned disguises as they headed for the Executive Tower.

In the Colosseum, thirty fighters were left in D Block as  Suleiman confronted Rebecca. Cavendish,  Orlumbus,  Damask, and  Mummy also emerged as standouts. Suddenly, Cavendish fell asleep, and his alter ego  Hakuba awakened. Hakuba struck down all the remaining fighters in an instant, and only Rebecca was able to dodge enough to be only slightly harmed. Hakuba fell asleep, and Rebecca got up, becoming the winner of D Block. The audience protested Rebecca's victory as the final round now approached.

Diamante was announced to be taking part in the final round, and Rebecca noticed that someone else was disguised as Lucy. The four contestants then headed back into the ring. Some D Block contestants raced in, angry at the results and wanting to challenge Rebecca again. However, Diamante stopped them with a piece of steel he turned into a cape with the power of the  Hira Hira no Mi before hitting them with a bull-shaped glaive. The gladiators were then attacked by the special new fighting fish in the water, which could leap up to attack the people in the arena. On the back of one of the fish was a chest containing the Mera Mera no Mi, and the five-person battle royale began.

Burgess unleashed a massive attack on a fighting fish and the audience when the fish with the Mera Mera no Mi popped up. Sabo leaped on its back, and Diamante attacked him, but Sabo shattered the executive's sword in two. Burgess then prepared to attack Sabo, but Sabo countered his blow with his hand, and his fighting style made Diamante suspicious. Rebecca then attacked Diamante, but her blunt blade did nothing as he hit her with a mace. Sabo told Bartolomeo to protect Rebecca, and Diamante revealed to her that he was the one who killed her mother.

Inside the throne room, Doflamingo had Doldo brought before him, boasting that the efforts to oppose him would be in vain as Law and the Straw Hats were in the process of faltering, unaware that anyone knew about his underground port or Sugar's location. Fujitora then came in, saying that while he would assist Doflamingo in opposing the Straw Hats in order to protect Dressrosa, he was not fully on the Warlord's side. Fujitora noted that Doflamingo's activities had been suspicious, and revealed his intention to bring an end to the Seven Warlords of the Sea system. This caused Doflamingo to attack him, but the two quickly stopped fighting in order to attend to business.

Senor Pink gave Franky a stiff challenge with his  Sui Sui no Mi powers, although displayed many odd quirks. Machvise then attacked Franky by  increasing his weight and slamming into the ground, and Bastille's forces arrived to confront Franky as well. Despite being overwhelmed, Franky was committed to his task of taking down all his attackers, but despite his best efforts, he was defeated.

Outside the palace, Wicca guided Luffy, Zoro, and Kin'emon as they prepared to enter it, and Viola approached them to help them get in. Since they would draw suspicion by taking the lift, Viola guided them to a secret staircase, but rather than use that, the Straw Hats went up using the chamber's pulley. After going up, Viola prepared to take them to a secret rampart entrance, but Luffy punched through the main gate instead. The guards reported to Doflamingo about Luffy's intrusion, and the Warlord was taken aback as he saw the disguised Sabo on the Colosseum feed. While they were inside, Luffy, Zoro, Kin'emon, and Viola were quickly confronted by Pica, who had become a giant stone man with the power of the  Ishi Ishi no Mi. By assimilating with the stone in the palace, Pica pulled the walls onto the intruders. Zoro stayed behind to confront Pica while Luffy and Viola went through the moving corridors, and Zoro could not find Pica's real body.

Some of the Donquixote Pirates went up to confront Franky, and Thunder Soldier and Kabu sneaked into the lift they were on before the former attacked them with his sheer speed. However, Lao G was on the lift as well, and overpowered both the Soldier and Kabu. He beat up Thunder Soldier the rest of the ride, and Kabu then led some dwarves to take on Lao G while he and Rampo took the Soldier to the throne room. However, they were confronted by Gladius, who used the  Pamu Pamu no Mi to rupture his forearms and injure the dwarves in the explosions. He then grabbed the Soldier and was about to rupture him before being attacked by Luffy, and Luffy and Viola took the Soldier away. Gladius attacked them with shrapnel, and Luffy burst out the window and pulled the three of them to the second floor. Gladius then encountered Kin'emon disguised as Doflamingo, and Kin'emon discovered that Kanjuro had escaped from the scrap heap in the Toy House. Luffy, Viola, and Thunder Soldier hid underneath the window of the throne room, where they heard Doflamingo interrogating Law about the Straw Hats' actions with the Tontatta.

Thunder Soldier remembered his past life as the legendary gladiator Kyros. As a boy, he was a violent criminal who grew up in the slums, but King Riku gave him the opportunity to fight in the Colosseum for his freedom. Kyros stayed in the Colosseum and won thousands of matches without being defeated, even taking down fighters who came from afar. However, he was depressed that he would forever be seen as a killer. After defeating Doldo himself in his 3,000th match, Doldo made Kyros commander of his army. As commander, Kyros saved the princess  Scarlett, Viola's older sister, from a pirate crew. She fell in love with him afterwards, having her death staged so she could live with him. The two had Rebecca, but Kyros refused to touch her with his blood-stained hands. When Doflamingo took over Dressrosa, Kyros went to the royal palace to rescue King Riku, where  Seastone chains were wrapped around his leg. He cut his leg off to attack Doflamingo, but was turned into a toy by Sugar. He managed to escape with Doldo, but was left with no one remembering him as he watched his wife die and raised Rebecca as the Thunder Soldier. Back in the present, Gladius' group approached the Soldier, Luffy, and Viola.

In the port, Robin and Usopp watched as Sugar turned Cavendish into a toy and forced him to work with the other gladiators in the port, and Leo unveiled the  Tatababasco, the hottest spice in the world, which they planned to hide among Sugar's grapes in order to knock her out. Leo then went up to Sugar with the Tatababasco, but when Robin saw Trebol hit a fly with a fast and precise mucus shot, she held Leo back, saying that even he would have been caught by Trebol. As the Tontattas' comrades were being forced to work in the SMILE Factory under the lie that they were finding a cure for Mansherry, Robin went up to Trebol, claiming that there was a problem with a crew at the port in order to lead him away from the tower. When Trebol was gone, the dwarves confronted Sugar and prepared to forcibly knock her out, but Sugar turned all of the attacking dwarves into toy bears, forcing them to attack their comrades who no longer remembered them. She then told Trebol that she was under attack, and after briefly checking on Robin's problem, Trebol attacked Robin and tried trapping her in mucus with the  Beta Beta no Mi, although found out that the Robin who went with him was a clone. He then responded to Sugar's distress by throwing a ship at the Executive Tower.

Trebol caught the Tontattas and learned about their plan, and he attacked them by lighting the mucus they were stuck to. Usopp went to Leo and told him to run away, but Leo replied that the Soldier would definitely defeat Doflamingo if they accomplished this. He had faith in the Soldier, as he was the only toy not under Sugar's contract and was formerly the legendary Kyros. However, the dwarves were decimated by Trebol, and Robin was turned into a toy by Sugar after trying to attack her, and Usopp decided to run away rather than confront the Donquixote Pirates alone. However, he overheard the dwarves calling out his name as they told Trebol that he would come to rescue them, and Trebol mocked them as he started stepping on them. Usopp came back, confessing to the dwarves his true identity and saying he was no hero, but would become this now as he shot Trebol with a  Pop Green shuriken. After a brief battle, Usopp was defeated, and Sugar decided to torture him by feeding him the Tatababasco. However, the Tatababasco caused Usopp to make a terrible expression which frightened Sugar so much that she fell unconscious.

#### The Curse Lifts: Chaos Rises in Dressrosa[]

With Sugar knocked out, the toys around Dressrosa returned to their human forms, and the people's memories of the toys returned, causing Dressrosa to fall into chaos. In the underground port, the dwarves celebrated Usopp's actions, and in the palace, Thunder Soldier transformed back into Kyros. In the Colosseum as chaos erupted in the audience, Rebecca remembered that she had a father as Sabo decided to end the match, using  Ryusoken to shatter the arena. He then leaped up to the fish carrying the Mera Mera no Mi and ate the fruit, before grabbing Rebecca and using  to punch through the bottom of the Colosseum. Hajrudin grabbed Usopp and held him up before the other freed toys, who rejoiced in their savior as the ceiling gave in and the Colosseum fighters fell in. Diamante found himself under attack by the freed toys, while Rebecca and Bartolomeo discovered Sabo's true identity as Sabo reunited with Koala and Hack. They revealed that they had come to find and stop Doflamingo's Underworld weapons trade for the Revolutionary Army. Diamante and Trebol worked together to stop the freed toys from attacking the SMILE Factory, and Robin reunited with the Revolutionaries as Kin'emon escaped down to the underground port and reunited with his allies.

In the palace, Pica abandoned his fight with Zoro. In the throne room, after returning to his human form, Kyros charged at Doflamingo as Doldo and Viola regained their memories of him. Kyros then decapitated Doflamingo as Luffy raced in to rescue Law. As Kyros took out several of Doflamingo's men including  Buffalo and freed Doldo, Luffy worked to free Law from his Seastone handcuffs. However, Pica then arrived, and Doflamingo was revealed to still be alive as he stated that he would have to use the "" As Kyros attacked him, the real Doflamingo swooped in to kill him, but Luffy pulled him out of harm's way. Luffy fought the two Doflamingos but was overpowered, with the decapitated Doflamingo being revealed to be a string clone. On Doflamingo's command, Pica forced Luffy, Law, Kyros, Viola, and Doldo outside as Doflamingo's string clone transformed into a cage of strings that surrounded the entire island.

With the  surrounding the island, no one could get out, communications to the outside world were cut off, and Doflamingo took control of some people and caused them to attack others, making the citizens realize that Doflamingo framed King Riku and that they have been manipulated for an entire decade. Pica then changed the layout of the island, placing the palace on top of Flower Hill and bringing the SMILE Factory above ground. Doflamingo then proclaimed to his citizens that he had a "game" for them. They could either kill him, or bring in his enemies for a monetary reward. He put bounties on the Straw Hats, Law, Kin'emon, Kyros, Doldo, Viola, Rebecca, and Sabo, with Usopp's being the highest at 500,000,000. The freed toys that had just paid gratitude to Usopp immediately began chasing him and his comrades, and Kin'emon leaped into the scrap heap to find Kanjuro. Usopp's group went up to the surface and contacted Luffy's group, who was on the King's Plateau where the palace once was. Kyros had already left to go after Doflamingo, and Luffy promised to Rebecca to take down Doflamingo. Law warned that this would bring down  Kaidou's wrath upon them, but Luffy replied that they needed to help Dressrosa as he took Law and Zoro and jumped off the Plateau.

The Marines worked to protect the people of Dressrosa as the freed gladiators emerged from below the Colosseum, including Maynard. Maynard reported to Fujitora about Doflamingo's illegal dealings, but Fujitora questioned the World Government's role in dealing with this. On top of the palace, the Donquixote Pirates met to discuss their situation, with Doflamingo being confident that they would dispose of everyone in their way. Pica offered to dispose of them himself, and one of the pirates laughed, causing him to be shot by  Baby 5 before Pica could become enraged. Doflamingo warned his lower-ranking crew to not make fun of the officers, whom he considered his family. Afterwards, Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger returned to the place where they fought Franky, only to find out he escaped. As Franky ran discreetly toward the SMILE Factory, Luffy, Zoro, and Law landed in front of the three Donquixote officers. Senor Pink, Machvise, and Dellinger were joined by some citizens as they attacked Luffy, Zoro, and Law, but the latter three managed to avoid the attacks and ran off, though only to be confronted by Fujitora. Zoro briefly clashed with the Admiral, but they were soon interrupted by Pica, who had become a massive stone behemoth.

#### Get Doflamingo! The Perilous Race Up the Plateau[]

Luffy laughed profusely at Pica's voice, causing the executive to punch him with his massive stone fist. The punch shook the ground and sent Luffy, Zoro, and Law flying all the way to the Colosseum. There, they encountered Cavendish, who had put aside his hatred of Luffy and wanted to defeat Doflamingo. Cavendish was soon joined by the Chinjao Family, Hajrudin, Elizabello, Dagama, Abdullah, Jeet, Orlumbus, Ideo, Suleiman, and Blue Gilly, and they all wanted to take down Doflamingo themselves, causing an argument to break out. However, when some other gladiators came to capture Luffy, Zoro, and Law, the group quickly came together to beat them off. Luffy then reunited with Ucy, and led the charge to the palace despite everyone continuing to argue over Doflamingo. Pica and his subordinates saw them coming, and Pica tried attacking them again, only to have his stone arm shattered by Chinjao and Elizabello.

Pica quickly regrew his arm and attacked again, but Luffy managed to ride Ucy onto his other arm, with Abdullah and Jeet having joined him, Zoro, and Law on the bull's back. Pica prepared to attack them, but Luffy shattered his head with a  punch. Pica's real body then emerged in front of the bull riders, and he tried attacking them with a giant sword, but Luffy helped Ucy dodge it and Zoro confronted Pica, allowing the others to continue toward Doflamingo. Since Pica's stone body was no longer inhabited, the other gladiators went after Luffy, and as they drew closer to the palace, Law revealed to Luffy that he wanted to take down Doflamingo to avenge an important person to him called  Corazon, who was Doflamingo's real brother but was killed by him 13 years ago.

In the streets below, Kyros moved past the citizens who were trying to capture him. Meanwhile, Usopp, Robin, Rebecca, Bartolomeo, Hack, and the Tontattas ran away from the citizens through the Colosseum stands, and Hack noticed that Sabo had run off. They managed to get to safety on the King's Plateau, where they encountered Doldo, Viola, and Tank Lepanto. Viola revealed that she had the key to Law's Seastone handcuffs, and Doldo was initially wary about trusting pirates to help them, but Viola assured him that Luffy's intentions were genuine. Rebecca offered to take the key to Law, and Leo offered to help her get to the palace by going across rooftops with him and Kabu accompanying her.

Franky prepared to blow open the entrance to the SMILE Factory, but was attacked by Senor Pink, who came to settle the score between them. As they fought, the Tontattas arrived and worked to find a way to get into the Factory.  Bian used her pink bees to fly over the roof, and after getting the enslaved dwarves' attention, she revealed to them that the Donquixote Pirates had been lying to them about Mansherry. Believing their comrades, the dwarves began attacking their overseers. Led by Mansherry's aide  Maujii, they broke into the room labeled as Mansherry's, but found it was only a storage room. They then went to open the main doors, and Franky distracted Senor Pink by saying there was an old woman in danger, allowing him and the Tontattas to get in the Factory. The Factory manager  Kyuin arrived to attack the dwarves with her vacuum cleaner but was stopped when Franky hugged her. Senor Pink then returned after discovering Franky's deception, and Franky suplexed Kyuin into him. This made Kyuin angry, but Franky silenced her by kissing her, making her flustered. Senor Pink agreed with Franky's course of action, and Kyuin and Pink's entourage swooned over the men as they resumed their battle.

Gladius, Dellinger, Machvise, Lao G, and Baby 5 went up to the New King's Plateau, where they watched in shock as Luffy, Law, and the gladiators beat back the Donquixote soldiers and reached the first level of the Plateau. Down below, Fujitora and his troops were stopped from pursuing the gladiators by Sabo, who confronted them to protect Luffy. Sabo overwhelmed the Marines as he destroyed their weapons by flexing his fingers, and he did the same to Bastille's sword and mask, defeating the Vice Admiral. Fujitora brought down a meteor, but it was sliced and scattered by the Birdcage. Sabo revealed his relationship to Luffy, and he and Fujitora clashed. The two fought ferociously, and Sabo asked how long Fujitora would waste time fighting him; the Admiral replied that he had decided to bet his life on this course of action.

The gladiators caught up to Luffy and his entourage by climbing the cliff of the Plateau, and the Funk Brothers approached Luffy, offering him a shortcut to the Flower Field on the fourth level of the plateau. Luffy and Law headed into a tunnel, knocking Abdullah and Jeet off, and the latter duo discovered that the Funk Brothers had led them into a trap before Doflamingo arrived and took out the brothers. Luffy and Law received a call from Robin to let them know that she, Bartolomeo, and Rebecca would be going to give Law the key to his handcuffs. However, the tunnel led to a dead end, and Luffy, Law, and Ucy were trapped in a pool of water as they were confronted by Doflamingo. Doflamingo mocked their weak state and shot Ucy with string, but before he could attack further, he was attacked by Abdullah and Jeet. They then discovered that Doflamingo was a string clone, and Abdullah and Jeet told Luffy and Law what happened, revealing that the gladiators had overtaken them to Level 2. As Kyros made his way up to Level 1, Luffy punched through the tunnel's ceiling, allowing him and Law to jump up to where the gladiators were while Abdullah and Jeet took care of Ucy.

On the King's Plateau, Leo brought out the  Yellow Kabu Beetles, which would slow down Robin's, Rebecca's, and Bartolomeo's falls and allow them to jump across rooftops until they reached the Flower Field. They reached the Pica statue, where Zoro was still fighting the Donquixote executive. Pica inhabited his statue again in order to attack the trio, but Zoro stopped him by cutting it in half. Pica resumed fighting Zoro as the Yellow Kabu group drew closer to the Flower Field, and Leo received a call from Maujii, who revealed that Mansherry was not in the Factory and suggested that she might be in the palace.

On the Plateau, Cavendish approached Luffy and Law, saying that he had a plan. Luffy and Law rode with Cavendish on his horse  Farul to reach the third level, and Kyros rode with them. Luffy revealed that they were going to meet Rebecca, and Kyros stated that he wanted to kill Diamante to avenge his wife. Meanwhile, the Donquixote Pirate officers confronted and overpowered the other gladiators, but as Farul rode into the battleground, the gladiators cleared a path for Luffy and his entourage to get to the next level, promising to keep the Donquixote officers at bay. Although Dellinger took out Suleiman, Dagama, and Blue Gilly, the gladiators continued the fight, and Cavendish stated that there would be no way to get off the island except by beating Doflamingo. As they reached Level 3, however, they were confronted by giant nutcrackers.

In the scrap heap, Kin'emon reunited with Kanjuro, who had hidden inside the wall as a drawing with his  Fude Fude no Mi power and drew food to feed himself. Kanjuro drew a bird to fly them out, although the drawing was so pitiful that it could barely fly. The other prisoners in the scrap heap asked Kanjuro to help free them as well, and Kanjuro complied, drawing ladders for them to climb up to the surface. In the town, the citizens found the location of Usopp and Doldo, and went to capture them in hopes of ending Doflamingo's game. Usopp saw the mob heading for them, and after hearing about Maujii's discovery, Viola looked around the palace for Mansherry, who was being held in a small cell somewhere. Kin'emon and Kanjuro then made it to the King's Plateau, and to Usopp's horror, Kanjuro revealed that he had drawn a net for the mob to climb up.

Viola found Mansherry, and told Leo where she was as his group reached the third level of the Plateau. However, Gladius attacked the group with exploding balls, causing Robin and Bartolomeo to fall. As she tangled with Gladius, Robin told Rebecca to go on to the Flower Field. Viola then saw the nutcrackers attacking Luffy's group and discovered that Sugar had been revived. Sugar decided to go out and turn Doflamingo's enemies into toys again, starting with Luffy and Law. One of the nutcrackers bit Farul's head, incapacitating him, and the massive toys put themselves back together despite Luffy's and Cavendish's attacks. Robin, Bartolomeo, and Gladius then fell onto the scene, and Bartolomeo told Luffy's group to go on ahead to Rebecca. He created a staircase for them to get to the Flower Field, and Cavendish stayed behind in order to take down the nutcrackers and avenge Farul. Bartolomeo shielded Luffy, Law, and Kyros from Gladius' attacks with his own body, and Robin confronted Gladius to protect her captain.

Rebecca, Leo, and Kabu made it to the Flower Field, and as the dwarves went to save Mansherry, Rebecca found herself confronted by Diamante. Not wanting to fight, Rebecca ran away, but Diamante cut her and prepared to shoot her just like he did to Scarlett. Right then, Kyros came and attacked Diamante, telling Rebecca that she would no longer have to fight. Luffy and Law then came to get the key to Law's handcuffs, and once Law was freed, he used his powers to cut apart the nutcracker chasing them. Luffy and Law headed for the palace, and Diamante tried to stop them, but Law teleported them inside.

The Donquixote Pirates quickly spotted the duo in the palace, and Sugar went to turn them into toys. Luffy and Law did not know who she was as she approached them, and on the King's Plateau, Usopp moved quickly to stop Sugar. He had Kanjuro draw him an effigy of the face he made to knock out Sugar the first time, and Doldo, Lepanto, and Hack went to slow down the mob heading for him. Usopp aimed with the help of Viola's sight, and he suddenly became able to  see people's auras inside the palace. He fired his shot right as the mob caught him, and it successfully passed in front of Sugar and scared her into unconsciousness again before she could turn Luffy and Law into toys again. This also turned the nutcrackers back into their original bodies, with each one having been made from eight Donquixote soldiers.

After catching Usopp's group, the mob revealed that they had no intention of bringing them in to Doflamingo, as they knew he had deceived them before when he took over Dressrosa and they placed their trust into King Riku once again. In the streets below, Fujitora departed from his fight with Sabo, and Koala berated Sabo for getting involved in the conflict. Sabo remembered how Fujitora was not leaving it to the Marines to stop Doflamingo, and on the King's Plateau, Doldo told the citizens to place their hopes on Luffy and his crew to take down Doflamingo as Fujitora came up to make the same bet. Elsewhere, Maynard was shocked to hear what Fujitora did as he and his troops were busy helping the citizens suffering from Doflamingo's attacks.

#### The Debt and Grudge of an Outcast: Law's Sorrowful Past[]

On top of the palace, Doflamingo reminisced to Trebol about when he first met Law, recalling how Law wanted to join his crew as a child because he wanted to destroy everything before he himself died soon. Bellamy then came to Doflamingo, wanting to know why Dellinger had been sent to kill him. Doflamingo replied that the two of them had always had different goals, and he took down Bellamy before being confronted by Luffy and Law. Luffy got mad at what Doflamingo did to Bellamy, and attacked the Warlord, but Doflamingo used Bellamy as a human shield. Doflamingo then attacked Law with a string clone while he took control of Bellamy and forced him to attack Luffy. Luffy refused to attack Bellamy, and to his opponents' confusion, he charged toward Law instead. Law then used  to switch places with Doflamingo, causing Luffy to hit Doflamingo with  while Law cut Trebol into pieces.

Trebol was left unable to reattach himself for a while, although Doflamingo was still up on his feet and stopped Law from attacking his subordinate. He and Bellamy then overpowered Luffy and Law, and Doflamingo stated that he did not have the time to deal with this, as his desire was to destroy the world ruled by the World Nobles out of anger for his father relinquishing his family's status and causing him to see "hell." Doflamingo's clone then sent Luffy and Bellamy inside the palace, leaving Doflamingo alone with Law. Law wondered how Doflamingo used his World Noble status to fake his resignation despite no longer being a World Noble, and Doflamingo revealed that he knew about the existence of a national treasure on Mary Geoise that gave him leveraging power over them. He stated that with Law's  Ope Ope no Mi powers, he could have had a surgery performed on him that would allow him to live forever and use the treasure to take over the world, but angrily stated that Law had gone against him despite everything he gave to him. However, Law replied that it was Corazon who made him into the person he was today.

Sixteen years ago, in the  North Blue, Law, Buffalo, and Baby 5 had joined the Donquixote Pirates as children despite the crew's toughness, and Law looked forward to killing before he died in a little over two years. He then encountered Corazon, whom Diamante and Trebol stated to be mute, clumsy, and a kid-hater as he grabbed Law and threw him out the window. Law made it back to the building, where the crew was eating. They noticed that he had  Amber Lead Syndrome that had infected his hometown  Flevance, and Law revealed that he had escaped by hiding in a mass of corpses. He swore revenge on Corazon, but Baby 5 reminded him that attacking the executive would cause Doflamingo to unleash retribution. Afterwards, as they were pillaging a town, Baby 5 asked Gladius and Lao G about Flevance. They revealed that Flevance had become prosperous 100 years ago by mining Amber Lead, but the World Government failed to reveal to them that it was poisonous on contact. Each progressive generation's lifespan grew shorter, and when symptoms of the syndrome appeared, Flevance was cut off from the outside world. The World Government allowed children Law's age to flee the island, but this was only a ruse as the people of Flevance were all exterminated. Law had broken off from his group to check on his family, only to discover that his parents were shot and his sister  Lamy was still in his family's hospital that the government burned down.

Law had joined the Donquixote Pirates with no reason left to live, and he went ahead with getting revenge on Corazon as he stabbed the executive in the back. He was spotted by Buffalo, but bribed him with ice cream to be silent. Meanwhile, Doflamingo had a nightmare about him, Corazon, and their father  Donquixote Homing being persecuted by a mob for being World Nobles. Seventeen years before this time, and 33 years before the present day, Homing had decided for his family to leave Mary Geoise and live as commoners. However, an 8-year-old Doflamingo did not understand his new position and treated the commoners like he was still a noble, causing them to realize what his family was and persecute them. The Donquixote Family's mansion was burned down, and they were forced to live in a shack and scavenge for food as they hid from the townspeople. Doflamingo's mother died to sickness, and the townspeople eventually caught Doflamingo, Corazon, and Homing.

Doflamingo woke up from his nightmare and received a call. He had Law brought to him, and Law thought Corazon had told Doflamingo what had happened, but Doflamingo instead told Law that he was becoming an official member of the Donquixote Pirates. Later, Corazon lied to Doflamingo that an enemy had wounded him, which surprised Law. A year passed, and the Donquixote Pirates moved around the North Blue as Law grew stronger through training and raids. One day, he was talking to Buffalo and Baby 5, and revealed that his real name was Trafalgar D. Water Law. Corazon then came and dragged him into an alley, where he spoke to Law and told him that if he was a  D., he needed to get away from Doflamingo. He used his  Nagi Nagi no Mi abilities to prevent people from overhearing them, and revealed to Law that much of his personality was an act, and that he had joined the Donquixote Pirates to stop Doflamingo. He believed his older brother had always been evil, as when they had been lynched by the mob as children, Doflamingo refused to die and swore revenge on the commoners. He then revealed that the carriers of D. were rumored to be the "natural enemies of God," and so did not want Law to become like Doflamingo. Law rejected this as he wanted to kill people like Doflamingo did, and he ran off to reveal Corazon's secret. However, as Corazon walked to the ship while the crew prepared to set sail, Law revealed that he kept his secret in order to repay him for not telling Doflamingo about getting attacked. As the crew was being pursued by Marines, Corazon took Law and departed to find a cure for his illness.

Law did not want to leave, and Corazon contacted  Sengoku to report on Doflamingo as an undercover Marine  Commander. After their call was finished, the undercover Donquixote Pirate and first Corazon Vergo came into Sengoku's office to request to be transferred to  G-5. Corazon was confident that they would get Law cured at a hospital, but at each one they went to, the doctors refused to go near Law and called the government to get him, causing Corazon to attack all of them as Law fell into despair. Six months passed with no luck, and one night as Law slept, Corazon wept over his condition, and Law overheard this, causing him to gain a respect for Corazon. The next morning, Doflamingo called Corazon, revealing that he had found out about a pirate crew selling the Ope Ope no Mi to the World Government, and telling his brother and Law to come back to the crew so they could get the fruit and heal Law with it. After the call, Corazon revealed that he would get the fruit for Law behind the crew's backs before abandoning them, as he did not think he could rejoin the crew without Doflamingo finding out the truth about him. Meanwhile, Doflamingo was growing suspicious that the Marines had not found his crew during the time that Corazon had been gone. Corazon contacted Sengoku, and they arranged a plan to trap the Donquixote Pirates on  Swallow Island during the planned exchange three weeks from now. To Corazon's horror, however, Law grew very weak as his time was almost up.

Corazon and Law sailed to  Minion Island, where the keepers of the Ope Ope no Mi, the  Barrels Pirates, were hiding out. Corazon left Law in the town as he raided the pirates' hideout, attacking them without making a sound and stealing the fruit. However, he tripped and fell as he ran outside and landed in front of some of the pirates, who realized that he had stolen the fruit. Corazon defeated them, but sustained several gunshot wounds in the process. He returned to Law and fed him the fruit, but was too weak to go any further. He asked Law to look for a Marine spy ship and give them a letter, which he claimed would help protect Dressrosa. Law found Vergo near the ship and gave him the letter, but then asked him to come and help Corazon. When Vergo came to Corazon, the two recognized each other in shock, and Vergo realized Corazon's treachery as he beat him and Law up. He then contacted Doflamingo to reveal the truth about Corazon, and Corazon managed to escape with Law, but Doflamingo trapped them by creating a  around Minion Island.

Corazon remembered when Doflamingo killed their father when they were children for taking them out of Mary Geoise, and he hid Law in a treasure chest, assuring that he himself would not be killed by Doflamingo as he silenced Law. The Donquixote Pirates massacred the Barrels Pirates as they searched for Corazon, and after finding him, they beat him up before Doflamingo confronted him. Corazon pulled a gun on Doflamingo, saying he could not let Law follow in his brother's footsteps. Corazon could not pull the trigger, but Doflamingo did, and he believed Law had been taken in by the Marines. This allowed Law to escape, and Corazon stayed alive just long enough to keep Law's cries from being heard, but then succumbed to his wounds.

In the present, Law revealed that he was a D. to Doflamingo as they fought, which shocked the Warlord. He then used his Devil Fruit to pierce through Doflamingo, saying that unlike Corazon, he would pull the trigger. Law went on the offensive, but Doflamingo quickly stopped his attacks, saying that Law was foolish to confront him alone and that everything he and Corazon aimed for would be for naught. He then sliced Law's right arm off and prepared to shoot him, but was interrupted as Luffy sent his string clone through the floor from below, defeating it. Bellamy was still under Doflamingo's control, and Doflamingo decided to free him. Luffy thought their fight was over, but as he remembered the time, he began sailing under the Donquixote Pirates'  flag out of admiration for them, Bellamy used  to fight Luffy, knowing that Doflamingo had rejected him but still being too proud to go against the man he admired. Luffy told him to stop, but Bellamy did not as he punched Luffy with a  Haki-clad fist, injuring him.

#### Dismantling the Family: The Decisive Conflict Against the Donquixote Pirates[]

Meanwhile, Zoro continued fighting Pica when he ran into some Donquixote soldiers. However, Orlumbus arrived and defeated them by bowling one into the others, and Zoro raced toward Pica as he inhabited the entire Plateau and attacked. The gladiators and the Donquixote officers were caught up in the attacks, and as this happened, Machvise was greatly overwhelming Hajrudin by pounding him with his increased weight. However, as Machvise prepared to finish him off, Hajrudin countered him with his fist. Despite Machvise's weight causing the bones in his arm to break, Hajrudin overcame his force and sent him flying upward into the Birdcage, defeating him.

As Sai fought Baby 5, the latter grew flustered as she interpreted Sai's statements to be flirtatious. Meanwhile, as he was being overwhelmed by Lao G, Chinjao overheard the statements and got mad at Sai for entertaining Baby 5's advances, saying he was arranged to marry  Uholisia of the  Niho Navy. Sai grew frustrated and jokingly told Baby 5 to die, and she prepared to commit suicide, as her childhood abandonment had left her with a desire to be useful to people. An appalled Sai tried to stop her, and Chinjao got annoyed at Sai trying to keep an enemy alive as he attacked the both of them. Sai responded by kicking Chinjao's drill head and bending it sideways, and an impressed Chinjao made him the next Don of the  Happo Navy. Right then, however, Lao G arrived and defeated Chinjao, and as the Donquixote officer charged toward Sai, the new Don stated that if he won, he would marry Baby 5 and free her from the Donquixote Pirates' manipulation. He then used Hasshoken to kick Lao G in the head and send him flying far away into the plateau wall, defeating him. He then attended to his grandfather.

When Pica came to the Plateau and attacked, Ideo was able to land a hit on Dellinger, but was soon overpowered. On the third level, Bartolomeo shielded himself and Cavendish as Gladius made the ground rupture, and Robin went up to the Flower Field to help Rebecca. Bartolomeo protected her from Gladius' attacks before he and Cavendish both went on the offensive, and as this happened, Gladius saw Dellinger and told him to help. However, Ideo pressed his attack on Dellinger, and the fighting fish fish-man hybrid had to finish off his opponent by growing a set of fangs and biting into him. Dellinger then went to Level 3, but things had quickly changed as Cavendish had become Hakuba, and before he could react, Dellinger was swiftly struck down.

Bartolomeo and Gladius were left in shock, but Hakuba then turned his attention to Robin. She managed to hold him back, and Cavendish struggled to regain control of his body, but Gladius then prepared to blow up the wall they were climbing on. Bartolomeo went to attack him, but Gladius swelled himself up as well, threatening to pierce everyone with poisonous needles if Bartolomeo attacked. With the plateau wall threatening Robin, Bartolomeo created a barrier around himself and Gladius, attacking the officer as he took the full force of Gladius' explosion. However, as Gladius recovered, he revealed that Bartolomeo had missed his throat and prepared to blow up Robin and Cavendish. With no time left, Cavendish briefly gave control to Hakuba, allowing him to carry Robin up the wall with sheer speed right before Gladius blew it up, and he fell asleep as Robin reached the Flower Field. Gladius noticed that they had escaped, and as he was distracted, Bartolomeo hit him with a barrier-enforced punch, defeating him.

Some Donquixote soldiers then came to take Gladius away, and Viola reported to Leo that she had seen Giolla using Mansherry to heal the fallen Donquixote Pirates, including the officers, on the first floor of the palace. Leo and Kabu were urged to hurry, and Giolla discovered that she could use Mansherry's  Chiyu Chiyu no Mi powers to heal her fallen comrades by just forcing her tears to land on them. Leo and Kabu then came in right as Mansherry's tears were beaten out of her. Kabu moved the Donquixote Pirates out of the tears' path, and Leo stitched them and Giolla together, pulling them all onto her and defeating her. He rescued Mansherry, and on her request, carried her out of the palace. Giolla tried to report this to Doflamingo, as Mansherry was also their contingency to repair the SMILE Factory, but was unable to do so.

Outside the SMILE Factory, Franky and Senor Pink took each other's attacks without dodging because of their manly spirit, and Senor Pink decided to perform his ultimate attack on Franky, offering to concede if Franky got up after it. He grabbed Franky and swam up a tall tower, and he mentioned his wife  Russian and son  Gimlet as he suplexed Franky into the ground far below. Franky got up after this attack, and Senor Pink conceded as Franky pummeled him. As he fell defeated, he remembered meeting Russian. Russian said she hated pirates, and Pink had claimed to be a banker. They got married and had Gimlet, but when Pink was voyaging with his crew, Gimlet died of a fever and Russian discovered his lie. She left him, but was caught in a landslide and put in a vegetative state. Senor Pink found that he could make Russian smile by wearing Gimlet's bonnet and pacifier, and so adopted this style of dress. In the present, Franky hoped Pink could tell him about Russian someday in the future, and he sent the Tontattas charging into the factory as he collapsed from his wounds.

On the Flower Field, Diamante caused the entire field to wave like a flag, making it hard for Kyros to stand. The executive then aimed his attacks for Rebecca, and she offered to assist her father, but Kyros forbade it as he promised to protect her. Diamante managed to get his sword around Kyros, but his strike was blocked by Robin, who gave Kyros the opportunity to focus entirely on Diamante. Diamante unleashed attacks called  that tore through a large distance, and Kyros began to get tired. Diamante then prepared to finish the fight as he shot spiked balls into the air, and Robin protected herself and Rebecca with a flower umbrella while Kyros batted away all the balls with his sword. A shocked Diamante resorted to shooting Kyros in the leg, causing him to be hit by the balls. An enraged Rebecca tried to attack Diamante, but Kyros got up, saying that she should preserve her clean hands as he charged at Diamante despite his injuries. The two fought ferociously, and Diamante tried to defeat Kyros with another , but Kyros countered it and broke through Diamante's sword as he cut him. As he fell backward, Diamante hit his head on Scarlett's gravestone, knocking him unconscious. Rebecca wanted to treat Kyros' wounds, but the two of them first sat in front of Scarlett's grave.

Elizabello went up to Zoro as the latter fought Pica, offering the help of his . Zoro had no use for it at the moment, but told him to save it up. On the King's Plateau, as Viola revealed that most of the Donquixote Pirates had been taken down, Doldo prepared to go down to assist the citizens in peril, which Fujitora was currently doing. Meanwhile, Pica went up to the Flower Field to confront Kyros, and he asked the gladiator about his thoughts on King Riku. Kyros replied that everyone on Dressrosa wanted him to return to the throne once Doflamingo was taken down, and Pica went down to attack the injured gladiators. As Zoro went after him, Pica told him that he was going to assert Doflamingo's rule by killing Doldo and everyone on the King's Plateau. He then reinhabited his giant golem and walked to the King's Plateau, and Zoro had to quickly think of a plan to catch up to him as cannon fire failed to harm the stone man.

Zoro decided to fly through the air and cut Pica up, and he ran to Elizabello to tell him to withhold his  for now. He then came to Orlumbus, and asked him to throw him toward Pica like the Admiral had done earlier. Pica arrived at the King's Plateau, and Doldo was prepared to take his attack; Pica then brought his massive hand down on the Plateau. Orlumbus then threw Zoro at Pica, and Zoro successfully bisected Pica at the waist. Taking note of which piece of stone Pica inhabited, Zoro continued cutting his body up until Pica was forced to come out. Pica cladded his entire body in Haki and leaped at Zoro, but Zoro proved his Haki to be stronger as he cut Pica with , defeating him. The remains of Pica's stone body fell toward the King's Plateau, but they were blown away by Elizabello's  and placed out of harm's way by Fujitora.

Zoro grabbed onto the King's Plateau, satisfied as he then remembered what  Mihawk had told him about using Haki during his training. He went up to praise from Usopp and the people around him, but told them not to be happy until the cage fell, and Doldo led the citizens down to help those in the streets. Meanwhile, the dwarves successfully destroyed the SMILE Factory, and Trebol was confident that Mansherry could help restore it, unaware that she, Leo, and Kabu were with Kyros, Rebecca, and Robin on the Flower Field. Elsewhere, Koala requested assistance from Sabo, saying that Luffy's life was possibly in danger. On top of the palace, Doflamingo and Trebol brutally overwhelmed Law, but Law remained defiant until Doflamingo tried to finish him off by shooting him. Down below, Bellamy continued to stand by Doflamingo and attack Luffy. Luffy finally ended the fight by punching Bellamy into the ground, and Bellamy silently thanked him for allowing him to maintain his convictions as Luffy went up to the palace roof. Luffy attacked Doflamingo, but after a brief fight, he encountered the defeated Law. Doflamingo then said that it was time to end this game as he started shrinking the .

#### Game Over: The Final Battle Against Doflamingo[]

As the cage closed, it cut apart everything it touched and forced everyone to run away, and Doflamingo said it would converge on everyone in about an hour. Law then spoke secretly to Luffy, having created a giant  around the palace before Doflamingo shot at him and switched places with a Donquixote servant below. Law told Luffy the plan, and as Luffy charged toward Doflamingo, Law switched places with him and hit Doflamingo with an attack that ruptured his internal organs. Luffy kept Doflamingo and Trebol from retaliating, and Law tried to finish off Doflamingo. Despite the fatal injuries he received, however, Doflamingo mended his injured organs with strings and rose up. With Law having collapsed, Doflamingo prepared to finish him off again, but was stopped by Luffy.

Luffy began fighting Doflamingo again, and as they clashed, their Haoshoku Haki created a black lightning-like effect. Trebol remembered when he, Vergo, Diamante, and Pica swore their allegiance to Doflamingo as children after discovering that he had Haoshoku Haki, and they treated him like the king that they believed those with the ability were, with Trebol giving Doflamingo his Devil Fruit and gun. After a ferocious fight, Trebol managed to catch Luffy in his mucus, and Luffy could not escape. Trebol then trapped Law and left him for Doflamingo to finish off, telling Law that the executives and Doflamingo had created a strong family. Law retorted that this was a lie, and Trebol attacked him in a fit of rage, allowing Law to use his Devil Fruit powers to spin his sword and vertically cut Trebol. The attack caused all the mucus to fall off Trebol's body, and in a desperate fit he lit up the mucus to create a massive explosion.

Luffy pulled Law away from the explosion and threw him down to Robin's group on the Flower Field. While Luffy kept Doflamingo occupied, he told Cavendish to get Law to safety, and Leo looked into stitching Law's arm back on. However, Law refused to leave, saying it was his responsibility to die if Luffy got killed in the fight that he had started. Cavendish stayed with him, and Robin, Kyros, Rebecca, Leo, Kabu, and Mansherry went down to Level 2 on Bartolomeo's staircase after the dwarves had fixed Law's arm. On top of the palace, Luffy continued fighting Doflamingo, but found that his  attacks were too weak, and his  attacks were too slow. Doflamingo mocked Luffy, saying he was the cause for Dressrosa's misery, but Luffy retorted that Doflamingo had been harming his friends long before that as he activated .

Luffy grew round and constantly bounced in his new form, and Doflamingo did not take it seriously until Luffy hit him all the way into the town below. Doflamingo initially struggled to keep up with Luffy's speed and strength, getting sent flying through buildings and not being able to dodge. However, he eventually managed to counter Luffy by turning buildings into string with his  awakened Devil Fruit powers and blocking the Straw Hat's attacks. During this time, Burgess went to the palace roof with Koala on his tail, and she wondered what he wanted with Luffy. Time passed, and the  grew considerably smaller, with the sick and weak being greatly threatened by it. King Riku then broadcasted himself to the citizens, telling them that the Donquixote Pirates were almost vanquished and encouraging them to keep going while Luffy fought Doflamingo. This gave the citizens strength and the will to help the weak, and up in the air, Luffy managed to break through Doflamingo's strings as he hit the Warlord of the Sea into the Palace Plateau wall. Doflamingo seemed defeated, but Luffy realized that he was still conscious due to the  remaining up. He went to deal a final blow, but  expired before he could, leaving him weak and barely able to move. Burgess then leaped down to the streets, intent on killing Luffy and gaining his Devil Fruit power. Doflamingo then moved to take down the powerless Luffy as well.

However, Luffy was approached by  Gatz, the announcer of the Corrida Colosseum. He revealed to Gatz that he needed ten minutes to regain his Haki, and he could finish off Doflamingo in one blow after that. Gatz then called in the Colosseum gladiators who had initially gone after Luffy and his comrades for Doflamingo's bounties, and they went to confront Doflamingo while Gatz carried Luffy away. They were attacked by Burgess, but the  Blackbeard Pirate was intercepted by Sabo. Sabo revealed his new Devil Fruit powers to Burgess and Luffy, and Burgess attacked, but Sabo sent him flying. However, Gatz saw Doflamingo easily take down the gladiators, and the Warlord sped up the  so it would kill everyone before Luffy recovered. Law then went into the streets, and told Gatz to leave Luffy with him for the rest of his recovery period.

Meanwhile, Zoro took Kin'emon and Kanjuro to go stop the . As he and the dwarves exited the destroyed SMILE Factory, Franky found out what they were doing, and got the idea to use the Factory to push against the  since the structure was made of Seastone. Meanwhile, Mansherry healed the gladiators on the Palace Plateau with dandelions made from her tears before flying on Kabu and scattering the dandelions all across Dressrosa, although they only healed people temporarily. The dandelions allowed the injured citizens to run from the , and they went to the Palace Plateau for safety. The remaining lower-ranking Donquixote Pirates had taken over the Plateau and blocked their access, but they were beaten away by Kyros and the gladiators. Sai then told the citizens that could still fight to come with him, and they went to the  to slow it down. Fujitora and the Marines then came to help as well, and for a brief moment they managed to stop the  completely. Meanwhile, Rebecca had run off to confront Doflamingo, only to discover that Viola had gotten to him first. Doflamingo easily countered Viola's attacks before immobilizing her, and he then took control of Rebecca as he forced her to charge at her aunt and kill her. As the people of Dressrosa continued slowing the , Gatz announced to them that Luffy would return soon and defeat Doflamingo in one blow. He led them in a countdown, and although Doflamingo attacked him before it was done, and Mansherry's dandelions began to wear off, the crowd cheered as Luffy's recovery period ended. Right before Rebecca was about to kill Viola, Law switched Luffy and Viola, and Luffy broke Rebecca's blade with his Haki as he confronted Doflamingo again.

Doflamingo initially overpowered Luffy with awakened attacks and managed to take control of the Straw Hat. However, as the  began cutting into the King's Plateau, Luffy activated  and broke the strings on him as he flew into the air. Doflamingo taunted Luffy, saying that he would get a new kingdom to replace the people in Dressrosa as though they were trash. Luffy blew into his arm, and Doflamingo put up both a defense and attack, but it was not enough as Luffy broke through his strings with  and hit the Warlord of the Sea, sending him falling into the ground with a force so great that it ripped the ground asunder and propelled him all the way to the underground port, breaking his sunglasses. Luffy fell unconscious, and Law brought him back down to his side. The  then came down, and Gatz proclaimed Luffy as the winner against Doflamingo as the people of Dressrosa rejoiced and Kyros shed tears for the first time in ten years.

#### Powers at Play: Dressrosa's Liberation and the Chaotic Aftermath[]

Sabo defeated Burgess after the latter unsuccessfully taunted him about Ace, and the other Revolutionaries successfully acquired Doflamingo's weapons from the underground port before the Marines came in. The Marines arrested the defeated Donquixote Pirates, and on Fujitora's orders, Maynard broadcasted to the neighboring islands what had happened to Dressrosa, which resulted in the news quickly spreading across the world. Meanwhile, the citizens pleaded for Doldo to return as their king despite his protests, and Fujitora approached him, offering his apologies for what the World Government did to Dressrosa as he and the Marines knelt before the returning king.

Doldo gave the citizens a place to stay in the palace, and elsewhere, Kyros disbanded the Tontatta rebel army. Meanwhile, on Mary Geoise, Sakazuki went before the  Five Elders to question why they had allowed Doflamingo to go behind the Marines' back, but they were not concerned about what he felt about Doflamingo. Right then, the six of them heard the news about Doflamingo's defeat, and the members of the Worst Generation found out as well.  Kid and his allies were glad that Luffy and Law's alliance was going after Kaidou and not their target,  Shanks. On a certain island,  X Drake was with Kaidou's crew when they received the news, and one of Kaidou's subordinates tried to tell their captain about it. Sakazuki got angry about the news getting out, and berated Fujitora for it. Fujitora stood by his decision, having been motivated to expose the truth by  Smoker recounting when the World Government covered up the truth about  Arabasta's liberation. Sakazuki threatened to bar Fujitora from all Marine bases unless he captured Luffy and Law, and Fujitora agreed to do this. However, he decided to only go after them if his die did not land on a one, and it indeed did.

The Straw Hats, Law, and Bellamy went to stay at Kyros' house as night fell, and Sabo arrived while Luffy was sleeping. He recounted his past to Zoro, Robin, and Franky, revealing that he had survived after setting sail from  Dawn Island and having his ship blown up by a World Noble. Dragon had rescued him, and he awoke with no memories of his past. He asked to join the Revolutionary Army, and it was only two years ago when he heard the news about Ace's death that he regained his memories. He despaired over Ace, and so when he reunited with Luffy in the Corrida Colosseum, he thanked his brother for staying alive. Sabo then departed from the house, giving the Straw Hats a Vivre Card he made for Luffy after taking a corner of it for himself. He headed toward the Revolutionaries' ship on a flock of crows as the Revolutionaries prepared to depart from the island before CP0's impending arrival. Meanwhile, as the other people in Dressrosa rested in the palace, Doldo spoke to Rebecca, telling her that once he became king again, she would become the crown princess.

The next day, Sanji's group on the Sunny had reached a mysterious island. As Sanji and Chopper forced Caesar to help an unknown group of people, Nami, Brook, and Momonosuke were chasing a girl. They were confronted by two pirates who were also looking for the girl, but they were suddenly interrupted as an eruption of water flooded the area. While Nami saved Brook and Momonosuke, the male pirate  Sheepshead attacked them, but Brook and Sanji managed to defeat him. With Sheepshead defeated, the other pirates decided to leave the island and abandon their mission of finding a  samurai. The Straw Hats continued looking for the girl, who was hiding, when Chopper suddenly called them to come to him. Meanwhile, Kaidou came up to the  Sky Island  Ballon Terminal, looking for a place to die. He jumped and fell 10,000 meters onto the  Kid Pirates' base, and emerged without receiving an injury. In his past, he had survived numerous execution and suicide attempts, and so had made attempting suicide his hobby. Kaidou confronted Kid, Apoo, and Hawkins, and he yelled out to Doflamingo, saying he was ready to start the biggest war in history to bring down a world he considered mundane.

Three days later, Sengoku and  Tsuru arrived in Dressrosa and discovered that Fujitora had still not gone after the Straw Hats and Law after landing on a one every day. Mansherry then came up to the Marine encampment and offered to draw blood from the Marines to heal citizens. The Marines complied, unaware that the dwarves were weakening them. Fujitora offered Tsuru the chance to roll the die, and it did not land on a one, causing him to send the Marines after the criminals in Dressrosa. In Kyros' house, Kyros revealed that he had spread a rumor that Rebecca's father was a faraway prince in order to disassociate her from him, and told her about it via letter, which Luffy did not like. Bartolomeo then came in, revealing that the Marines were on the move. The Straw Hats' allies were lying in wait to help, and Kyros had commissioned the dwarves to make preparations as well. Bartolomeo led the Straw Hats, Law, and Bellamy out of Kyros' house to the eastern port as the Marines came after them, but Luffy separated from them to go to Rebecca.

Doldo prepared to retake the throne, and Rebecca was attended to as she got ready for her coronation, although she wanted to see Luffy again. Luffy made it to the window of her room, where he asked her if she was fine with what Kyros had done. She replied that she was not and requested Viola to succeed her as the crown princess before Luffy broke her out of the palace. The citizens of Dressrosa were outraged at what they believed to be a kidnapping and chased after Luffy and Rebecca. The Marines shot at Luffy but collapsed due to Mansherry drawing their blood. Luffy dropped Rebecca off at Kyros' house, where she confronted him as he was about to leave the island. Kyros stated that she should not live with him because of the crimes he had committed, but Rebecca replied that she did not care as she embraced her father, wanting to live together with him. Back in the palace, Viola told Doldo about Rebecca's decision.

Meanwhile, the gladiators took out the Marines in the Straw Hats' way, allowing them to go to the eastern port, and the Tontattas had stolen many of the Marines' weapons while Leo had stitched together their battleships and Mansherry had weakened all the blood donors. However, Law disappeared, and Fujitora arrived to confront the criminals right as Luffy was returning from his detour. Law had gone to talk with Sengoku, revealing that he was the boy that Corazon saved. Sengoku reminisced about Corazon's actions, and Law questioned him about the importance of the D. in his name, but Sengoku brushed it off. Deciding not to arrest Law, Sengoku told the pirate to live free like Corazon had wished. Meanwhile, Fujitora lifted up a large amount of rubble to crush his opponents, and as Law and Luffy returned to their comrades, Luffy refused to run away from Fujitora and punched him instead.

The two began fighting, with Fujitora being annoyed and amused by Luffy telegraphing his attacks. He slammed Luffy into the cliffs around the shore, and Hajrudin grabbed Luffy as the Straw Hats and their allies ran toward the dock. They were still threatened by Fujitora's rubble, but before he could crush them, a mob of Dressrosa citizens ran past him, claiming to want to apprehend Luffy themselves for what happened to Rebecca. In reality, they knew the truth about Rebecca and wanted to protect the Straw Hats from Fujitora, and he withheld his attack. The gladiators took the Straw Hats and Law to Orlumbus' ship, the  Yonta Maria, and the seven groups among them, the  Beautiful Pirates, Barto Club, Happo Navy,  XXX Gym Martial Arts Alliance,  Tonta Corps,  New Giant Warrior Pirates, and  Yonta Maria Grand Fleet, all pledged to become subordinate to the Straw Hats and serve them. Luffy rejected their offer, as he wanted to sail freely on the seas without having to command anyone. In response to this, the crews made the decision to still serve Luffy, but only when he needed them to, and consumed sake cups to form the  Straw Hat Grand Fleet. They came under attack by a  pirate alliance who had come to take revenge on Luffy for taking down Doflamingo, but were saved when Fujitora dropped the rubble on the enemy pirates. They then feasted to celebrate the fleet's formation as they departed from Dressrosa.

Dressrosa returned to peace under King Riku's rule, and a new era began as the citizens began coexisting with the Tontatta Tribe. CP0 came to Dressrosa, among them being  Rob Lucci and  Spandam, only to find the Revolutionaries gone with Doflamingo's weapons. Elsewhere, the Marines set sail for Impel Down, and Fujitora stated that he would take a trip while he was currently barred from entering Marine bases. Below deck, Doflamingo talked to Tsuru, saying that his downfall would plunge the world into chaos as various groups would aim for the top and destabilize the current system of power, but she paid no mind to his words. Behind the Marine fleet, a pirate ship approached, and its captain,  Jack, was intent on going to rescue Doflamingo despite the powerful Marines in the fleet.

After the feast, Luffy had given pieces of his Vivre Card to the Grand Fleet members as well as Bellamy, who went off on his own. The Straw Hats and Law sailed to Zou on the Barto Club's ship, the  Going Luffy-senpai, and they discovered that they had all received bounty increases. As they examined their new wanted posters, they noticed with surprise that Sanji was now wanted "Only Alive."

### __Zou Arc__

#### The Perilous Journey to Zou: The Island on an Elephant's Back[]

While the  Going Luffy-senpai sailed toward  Zou, the  Straw Hat Pirates discovered that the  Barto Club had little knowledge on how to navigate through the ocean's waters as a hailstorm was raging.

At  Marine Headquarters,  Kizaru received a report that the  Warlord of the Sea,  Edward Weevil, the self-proclaimed son of  Whitebeard, had massacred the  A O Pirates, making them the sixteenth subordinate crew of the  Whitebeard Pirates that he had annihilated. Meanwhile, Weevil's mother,  Buckin, the self-proclaimed lover of Whitebeard, persuades Weevil to massacre all of Whitebeard's former subordinates to claim Whitebeard's treasure, as he is his only biological son. After learning of  Donquixote Doflamingo's defeat, Weevil and Buckin decided to go after  Luffy to get information on  Marco the Phoenix, Weevil's next target.

One week later, the Going Luffy-senpai reached Zou, which to everyone's shock is actually on the back of a giant, one thousand-year-old elephant.  Kanjuro revealed that Zou is the home of the  Mink Tribe, an isolated people which are said to hate humans. They docked at the elephant's leg alongside the  Thousand Sunny, which the Barto Club was excited to see. As the Barto Club bid farewell to the Straw Hats, Kanjuro drew a dragon,  Ryunosuke, to carry them up the elephant.

At the  Revolutionary Army's base on  Baltigo,  Dragon received several reports of Revolutionary victories due to the chaos that ensued when Doflamingo fell.  Koala reported that the weapons they took from  Dressrosa contained a rare steel known as  Liquor Iron Ore, and Dragon ordered her to summon the leaders of the Revolutionary Army. Meanwhile,  Laffitte received a call from  Jesus Burgess, who revealed that he found the Revolutionaries' base.

On  Karai Bari Island, the  pirate dispatch organization  Buggy's Delivery celebrated their increase in business due to Doflamingo's downfall. However,  Buggy received word that  Hajrudin and the other four  giants working for them had quit.

Meanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates continued the ride up the elephant's leg, and Luffy asked  Kin'emon and Kanjuro why they wanted to go to Zou. They revealed that they were looking for their lost comrade,  Raizo the  ninja. Suddenly,  Robin realized that something was flying towards Luffy.

The thing turned out to be  a monkey, and everyone managed to get out of its way, except Kin'emon and Kanjuro. The  samurai were fooling around and got knocked off the dragon's back onto the Thousand Sunny. The Straw Hats panicked, but Kin'emon assured them they were all right and told them to keep going as they would catch up later. The crew contemplated turning around to save the two but decided to go on without them.

#### The Mysterious Mink Tribe: Friends or Foes?[]

They eventually reached the top of the elephant's back and Ryunosuke became a drawing again. The Straw Hats and  Law began exploring the island and Luffy separated from the group in search of their remaining crewmates. While exploring Zou, the Straw Hats and Law came across a place called  Mokomo Dukedom, which appeared to be in ruins. As they explored, wondering what went through the city, a mink named  Carrot spied on them and was shocked that they got inside. The Straw Hats heard her rustling around, and Carrot rushed at them, clashing with  Zoro. However, a canine mink came and told Carrot to stop, as they had to deal with the intruders in the  Whale Forest.  Usopp then noticed with a shock that the mink was wearing  Nami's clothes.

Carrot leaped high into the air to find the intruder, and she and the canine mink prepared to head to the Whale Forest. The canine mink told the Straw Hats where they could go to find the corpse of their crewmate, causing them to panic. As they rode, the canine mink revealed to Carrot that she believed that Luffy was the invader, and that they would show him no mercy despite him being the Straw Hats'  Captain. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats and Law calmed down and decided to go to the city and find Law's crew. Law revealed that his navigator  Bepo is a mink, although he had left Zou long ago and had no memories of it.

Meanwhile, Luffy was in the midst of a confrontation with two mink  Guardians,  Roddy and  Blackback. The  Heart Pirates were also present and attempted to convince the guardians that Luffy was a friend, to no avail. However, the canine mink and Carrot came and pacified the guardians before telling the  other Guardians surrounding Luffy in the shadows to leave. The canine mink introduced herself as  Wanda and told Luffy that they did not want to fight him. As the Straw Hats explored the ruined city, they saw signs of a recent attack, and Wanda revealed to Luffy when they reached the outskirts that  Jack had laid waste to the city over the past couple of weeks. Wanda then offered to take Luffy to see his friends, which he was excited about.

The Eruption Rain began as the elephant, named  Zunesha, raised its trunk and spouted water onto the island on its back. This caused the streets of  Kurau City to become flooded, forcing the Straw Hats to climb up to higher ground. As  Wany swam through the flood, Wanda explained to Luffy how Zunesha cleans itself twice a day with the Eruption Rain and how they benefited from it. Bepo was separated from the three and told Luffy to tell Law where he and the others were. Wanda then saw the crosses in town and remembered how Jack tortured someone on them during his invasion, as he was looking for someone. Luffy asked who ruined the town, and Wanda told him that it was Jack. However, she also revealed that his obituary came out after launching a failed attack on the  Marine escort carrying Doflamingo. However, there was no body found, and Wanda believed that he may still be alive.

Usopp then spotted Luffy and the minks, and Law teleported the Straw Hats to them. Usopp confronted Wanda and Carrot and demanded that they hand over Luffy, and an exasperated Wanda explained that they meant no harm. The pirates and minks then reached the Right Belly Fortress, and the guards were shocked to hear that they were the Straw Hat Pirates. Inside,  Chopper woke up Nami, telling her their crewmates had arrived. The Straw Hats were surprised to receive a warm welcome from the minks, who do not really hate humans as was commonly believed. Nami and Chopper then embraced their crewmates, but a tearful Nami had a message about  Sanji.

Afterwards, the Straw Hats and the Mink Tribe had a feast, and  Brook reunited with his crewmates, revealing  Momonosuke was also in the fortress. The Straw Hats also found out that the "corpse" Wanda was referring to was just a nickname for Brook. When Luffy mentioned Kin'emon, however, Brook warned him to not mention samurai around the minks. Nami asked her crewmates what they should do about Sanji, but they reminded her that Sanji left a letter and that they still had no idea what was going on. Nami then decides to tell the story to them.

As the Thousand Sunny was escaping from the  Big Mom Pirates'  singing ship, which carried  Tamago,  Pekoms, and  Capone Bege, the crew debated on how to escape or counterattack. They then fired cannonballs, which Brook froze, and Sanji used a  kick to send them toward the ship, causing a large explosion. In the midst of this, Nami created a raincloud to fog the area, making it impossible for the Big Mom Pirates to spot them. This action allowed the Thousand Sunny to escape their pursuers. Nami revealed they reached Zou a day later. Wanda then informed the Straw Hats that the invasion had already happened before they arrived, although Nami's group saved the minks from certain annihilation. A mink then popped in and announced that the prince had awoken, causing all the minks to cheer. Chopper,  Miyagi, and  Tristan then went to attend to him, as the announcing mink revealed to Wanda that the prince,  Inuarashi, wanted to meet his benefactors, the Straw Hats. When Luffy asked who he was, Wanda revealed that he was one of the kings of Mokomo Dukedom alongside  Nekomamushi. Inuarashi had fallen into a coma since the city was destroyed.

Meanwhile, Law reunited with his crew.

#### Seventeen Days Ago: Jack's Invasion[]

Wanda told the story of Jack's invasion as she led the Straw Hats to Inuarashi. She revealed that they had thought the Bell of Welcome had rung, but it was actually the Raid Bell as Zou was being invaded. Zunesha howled as a giant mammoth stepped foot into Mokomo Dukedom, ordering the people to surrender Raizo to him. The minks then realized that they were being invaded by the  Beasts Pirates led by  Kaidou's right-hand man, Jack. The latter once more demanded the minks give up Raizo, but the minks refused, mentioning Raizo was not on the island. Despite their refusal, Jack destroyed a large part of the city while ordering his subordinates, the  Pleasures, to lay waste to the rest. The minks fought back, easily defeating the Pleasures, forcing Jack to bring in the  Gifters, led by  Sheepshead.

In the present, Wanda and the Straw Hats arrived at Inuarashi's sanatorium, where they received a warm welcome from Inuarashi and his guard  Shishilian. While talking with the duke, Chopper revealed to Luffy that Jack used  Caesar's  poison gas weapon to destroy the Mokomo Dukedom. Inuarashi revealed that he once met  Shanks as he fell asleep due to night falling. Wanda explained that the two rulers, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, were once inseparable friends, but were now antagonistic toward each other. The tension between them grew to a point where they split off their duties; Inuarashi rules during the day between 6:00 in the morning and 6:00 at night while Nekomamushi rules from 6:00 at night until 6:00 in the morning. Even Inuarashi's subjects fell asleep at 6:00 sharp as Nekomamushi's reign began.

Seventeen days ago, Inuarashi and the  Musketeer Squad arrived to stop Jack and the Gifters. Inuarashi laid down his sword and begged Jack to see reason, saying the pirate could search for Raizo all he wanted if he stopped the destruction. However, Jack refused and attacked Inuarashi, but the duke easily blocked Jack's strike. The Musketeers then attacked the Beasts Pirates, but the battle was short-lived as night fell and Nekomamushi awoke. Inuarashi ordered the Musketeers to retreat as Nekomamushi and the Guardians arrived. Nekomamushi rushed at Jack, grabbed his trunk, and flipped the pirate onto his back. Jack then reverted to his human form and prepared to fight back.

The Mink Tribe and the Beasts Pirates fought for five days and five nights, with neither side managing to overwhelm the other. Eventually, the minks gained the upper hand, and Jack eventually decided to use Caesar's gas weapon. The weapon made the minks helpless, and Jack and his underlings slaughtered dozens of warriors while tying Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, and several of the strongest warriors to crucifixes. The minks were tortured for Raizo's whereabouts, but they could only give the same answer.

The next day, Jack left Zou, leaving only some underlings behind, and Inuarashi later realized that he had gone to rescue Doflamingo, effectively making the Straw Hats who defeated Doflamingo their saviors. The same day, Sanji's group arrived and encountered Sheepshead chasing Tristan. After disrupting Sheepshead's attack, the Straw Hats chased after Tristan, but she was scared and ran away from them. They came to the ruins of Kurau City, where they saw the tortured minks on the crucifixes. One of them, Pedro, begged them to save Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, as they had lethal wounds and could not be allowed to die.

Caesar admitted that the gas, Koro, was his creation, and was forced by Sanji and Chopper to remove it from the air. Sanji defeated Sheepshead, who was attacking Nami's group, and the Beasts Pirates retreated. As the Curly Hats (Sanji, Nami, Chopper and Brook) entered the city, they were attacked by Wanda, who believed them to be with Jack. Wanda was weakened by the poison, and was easily subdued by Nami, but held up a bomb to blow them all up. However, Tristan and Pedro revealed to Wanda that the pirates were not affiliated with Jack and helped drive the Beasts Pirates away. The pirates then went to work curing the Mink Tribe of the gas.

#### Two Days Ago: The Curly Hat Caper[]

In the present, Chopper prepared to go check on Nekomamushi and the Guardians. He and the Straw Hats were accompanied by Wanda and Carrot as they rode into the Whale Forest. During their ride, Zoro asked what happened to Sanji and Caesar, and Brook revealed that Sanji was possibly unable to ever return to them. When they fought the Big Mom Pirates, they accidentally gave away that they were going to Zou, and Pekoms knew where it was as he was a native of the island. The Big Mom Pirates arrived on Zou two days ago, and Pekoms and Capone Bege entered the island. They discovered the ruins of Kurau City, and Pekoms flew into a rage at the sight of his birthplace destroyed.

Meanwhile, the Curly Hats celebrated with the minks. Nami swapped clothes with Wanda and received a treasured dress, and Sanji was very taken with the female minks. Momonosuke hid in his room, and Caesar disguised himself in order to avoid recognition. Meanwhile, Pekoms reunited with his tribesmen in tears, relieved that they had survived. Nami and Caesar saw Pekoms and Bege in shock, and Caesar begged them to help him. However, Sanji said he was worthless to them now that Doflamingo was defeated and asked what he did to  Big Mom. Caesar revealed that he was commissioned to do research for Big Mom which led to nothing, but he lied and took payment anyways. Sanji said he deserved what was coming for him, but also realized they were enemies of Big Mom as well. Caesar offered to team up with Sanji to assassinate the Big Mom Pirates, but Sanji told Brook to accompany him as they confronted the two pirates.

Pekoms tearfully thanked Sanji for saving his people, and he revealed that their missions were to capture Caesar and do something that would tear the Straw Hats apart. However, Pekoms said he would leave the Straw Hats alone in exchange for Caesar as his thanks. Bege yelled at him to not put his emotions over his mission, but Pekoms ignored him, and Bege shot the mink in the back using his  Devil Fruit powers. Bege unleashed his crewmates from inside his body, revealing that he ate the  Shiro Shiro no Mi and became a castle man. The  Fire Tank Pirates surrounded Sanji and Brook, and  Vito brought Nami and Chopper in. Bege told Caesar, who was up in the trees, that he would be shot with  Seastone bullets, causing Caesar to come down. Bege brought Caesar and the Straw Hats inside his body, chaining them all up except for Sanji, who sat at a table. Bege came to the table and revealed an invitation for a  Tea Party and wedding ceremony. Sanji, the third son of the  Vinsmoke Family, would marry  Pudding, the 35th daughter of the  Charlotte Family.

Sanji refused the invitation as Nami, Chopper, and Brook tried to think of what being from the Vinsmoke Family could mean. Bege told Sanji that he would come regardless of what he wanted as he manipulated the fortress, binding Sanji. Vito revealed a secret to Sanji, one which he was shocked that the Fire Tank Pirates knew. Sanji then requested to write a note for the rest of the crew, and told Nami, Chopper, and Brook to give the note to Luffy's group when they arrived, stashing it between the chains around Nami's waist. Suddenly, he threw them out of Bege's body, shocking the Fire Tank Pirates. He then held Caesar at gunpoint, saying that there was someone behind his "Only Alive" bounty and the marriage and that they would not allow him to be killed. He would come to the tea party with Caesar, but only if Bege spared his crewmates.

Suddenly, Bege was confronted by Nekomamushi, who asked why Pekoms was lying on the ground covered in blood. Bege attempted to bluff his way out by claiming one of Jack's men had remained behind and attacked them, as Nami asked Sanji why he was still in Bege's body. Sanji told her that this was his problem and promised to be back with a smile, despite the protests of his friends. He said his goodbyes as Bege converted his legs into tank treads and raced away. Wanda asked the Straw Hats if they should chase after them, but Brook, tearing up, said that Sanji had no intention of returning. Sanji had written that he had to see a woman and would be back soon.

#### The Minks and the Samurai: Unexpected Revelations[]

In the present, the Straw Hats continued riding to see Nekomamushi. Luffy was initially excited about the possibility of Sanji marrying, but was told that if he did, the Straw Hats would become subordinates of Big Mom. It was for this reason that led Brook to believe Sanji had cut himself off from the crew. However, Zoro reminded them that Sanji left of his own volition without apologizing, and that they had already angered Kaidou, making it unwise to directly challenge another  Emperor. This led to an argument, and Luffy decided to go and ask Sanji himself, but was reminded that Big Mom is a powerful Emperor and they could not invade her domain without a strategy.

The Straw Hats reached the Guardians' residential district and were greeted by the Guardians, who revealed that Nekomamushi and Pekoms were recuperating inside. They found Nekomamushi taking a bath and eating lasagna, which infuriated Chopper as he instructed the ruler to do neither of those things. Nekomamushi accidentally reopened his wounds while playing with a ball, forcing him back in bed. Meanwhile, Luffy talked with Pekoms, who revealed that Sanji's father and Big Mom arranged the wedding and that the Vinsmoke Family is a family of killers. This shocked Luffy and Nami, and Pekoms revealed that the Vinsmoke Family are the leaders of a military organization called  Germa 66. However, Luffy did not care about this, and only wished to avoid becoming Big Mom's subordinate. Pekoms assured him that he would not, as this was a family affair, but Sanji would never be a Straw Hat again after getting married. This angered Luffy, who ordered Pekoms to take him to the tea party and told Nami that he would go there alone, as it would increase his chances of infiltrating the party.

Luffy went outside, where he was met by Nekomamushi, who reopened his wounds while hugging him. As Nekomamushi was tended to, Luffy reunited with Law and his crew, and he told Law about Sanji's predicament. This shocked Law, who reminded Luffy that Kaidou would likely be coming after them and this would not be good for Zou. Touched by Law's compassion for them, the minks threw a party that lasted throughout the night. Meanwhile, Robin, Franky, and Brook sat guard at Zunesha's hip in order to prevent the samurai from entering Zou. However, they fell asleep, and the samurai arrived on the elephant the next day with the monkey mink. However, when Kin'emon asked the mink about Raizo, it ran off in distress to report the samurai's presence.

The three Straw Hat guards woke up and ran in distress in order to prevent the samurai from meeting the minks. The monkey mink, Bariete, rang the bell and shouted that samurai had arrived, and Kin'emon and Kanjuro reunited with Momonosuke in the forest. The Straw Hats raced through the Whale Forest in order to intercept the samurai, and Inuarashi and Nekomamushi both mobilized armies to search for the intruders. However, this led to the two rulers coming face to face, and they immediately began to squabble. This nearly led into a fight to the death, but as the two rulers began sparring, Kin'emon emerged to break up the fight. Despite the Straw Hats' pleas, the samurai introduced themselves to the minks and revealed that they were searching for Raizo. To the Straw Hats' shock, the minks kneeled down and said that Raizo was safe, revealing that they were friends with the  Kozuki Family of  Wano Country and that they would have let Jack kill them before turning Raizo over.

Kin'emon affirmed his position by showing the tattoo on his back, which Raizo had as well. When Inuarashi and Nekomamushi started talking to him, however, they began arguing again, causing Momonosuke to cry out for them to stop. Momonosuke said his father would be saddened to see this, and Kin'emon revealed that he is not Momonosuke's father; they merely acted as such in order to avoid drawing attention to the boy. Indeed, Momonosuke was the son of the  daimyo of Kuri in Wano Country,  Kozuki Oden. Inuarashi and Nekomamushi bowed before the young lord and reluctantly decided to truce, but the Straw Hats remained enraged as Momonosuke embraced Nami once more.

Later, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi led the Straw Hats, Law, and the samurai to the whale-shaped tree, and they trekked up toward its back. The rulers revealed a hidden door in the back of the tree leading inside a cave, and the pirates went inside while fantasizing about Raizo. They met Raizo, who was chained to a red  Poneglyph, and the samurai freed their comrade. The male pirates tried to get Raizo to do ninja techniques, but he refused until they turned away in disappointment, causing him to use some techniques.

#### The Alliance Grows: Preparing to Take On the Emperor[]

The samurai and some of the Straw Hats went outside, where the samurai surveyed Zou's destruction and wept. They were called back inside by Nekomamushi, who said that Robin was nearly finished translating the Poneglyph. Inside, Robin and Nami realized that the Poneglyph's message more resembled a map, and Inuarashi revealed that this was a Road Poneglyph. There were four Road Poneglyphs that each led to an island. If all four islands were discovered, the location of  Laugh Tale could be found. Of the other three, one was lost while the other two were kept by Big Mom and Kaidou. Luffy was excited to find this out, even though two of them were being kept by the Emperor, since he had always intended to take them down. Zoro inquired how the minks knew so much about Poneglyphs, and the two rulers revealed that the Kozuki Family was a family of stonemasons who invented the Poneglyph 800 years ago. However, the knowledge of how to read and write the language on Poneglyphs ended with Oden, who was executed by Kaidou and the  shogun of Wano Country while sacrificing himself to save his son and retainers. Kaidou was pursuing Momonosuke and the retainers because Oden was a former member of the  Roger Pirates, and he knew about a secret of Laugh Tale.

The Straw Hats were bewildered by this revelation, and Zoro realized that the secret of Laugh Tale is why Doflamingo and Kaidou's underlings were pursuing the samurai. However, they said that the secret was not passed down to them, but their only mission was to open Wano's borders and seek justice for Oden by killing Kaidou and the shogun. They had people of Wano as well as the Mink Tribe supporting them, but they were still outnumbered. Inuarashi stated that despite their loss to Jack, the minks still had a trump card in the upcoming war. Kin'emon then begged Luffy and Law to help them in the coming fight.

Luffy's crewmates were excited about the proposition, but Luffy refused, asking if Momonosuke was really the heir and leader over the samurai or if he was just a crybaby. His crewmates came to Momonosuke's defense, but the young heir walked up to Luffy, remembering how his parents were killed, and cried that he wants to fight Kaidou. Momonosuke said he wanted to avenge his parents and protect his retainers, but asked Luffy to help him in the fight. Luffy accepted, forming an alliance between pirates, samurai, and minks called the  Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, but stated that he wanted to get Sanji back first.

Meanwhile, the minks begin to throw a party to celebrate the truce between Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, remembering when the two were once friends. Unbeknownst to them, however, Jack and his fleet sailed up to Zou, with Jack ready to finish his job. However, this time he would not rush onto Zou and instead would kill Zunesha.

The pirates, samurai, and minks exited the whale-shaped tree, and Inuarashi and Nekomamushi revealed that they sailed with Whitebeard and  Roger as Oden's vassals, although they did not reach Laugh Tale. Oden's three samurai retainers did not go, as leaving Wano Country was a crime. Nami questions as to the correlation between the  Log Pose and Road Poneglyphs, and Inuarashi says that the Log Pose routes do not lead to Laugh Tale, but to another location. The alliance then decided what they will do next, with the samurai to head to Wano Country along with Inuarashi, Nekomamushi, the Straw Hats, and Law. However, Nekomamushi revealed that he first wanted to find Marco the Phoenix in order to gain more allies; however, Marco had been missing since a year ago, when the Whitebeard Pirates were defeated by the  Blackbeard Pirates in the  Payback War. Right then, the rest of the minks found the alliance and cheered upon seeing Raizo; the ninja then thanked them for everything they did. The minks prepared a banquet to celebrate the turn of events, and Nami had to hold back Luffy, saying they needed to leave. Nami, Chopper, and Brook decided to go to  Whole Cake Island with Luffy and Pekoms to rescue Sanji, and Robin told Luffy to copy the Road Poneglyph if he found one.

Suddenly, Zou began shaking as Nekomamushi heard Zunesha crying, and Luffy  heard a mysterious voice. Momonosuke heard it as well as Jack's fleet weakened Zunesha by firing at its front left leg, and Jack ordered his men to bring it to its knees so he could attack its head. Zunesha begged Momonosuke and Luffy to command it, but the two struggled to withstand the voice and understand what was happening. Zunesha's eyes began growing as Momonosuke saw a vision of Jack's fleet outside Zou. Momonosuke revealed what he saw, and the minks prepared to head out and engage Jack in battle, when he realized that Zunesha was the one talking to him. Momonosuke learned that Zunesha was sentenced to walk the seas for an eternity after committing a crime in the ancient past, and it could only attack on command. Zunesha told him to command it and let it fight as it started to fall, and Luffy shouted at Momonosuke to scream the order to Zunesha. Momonosuke ordered Zunesha to attack Jack, and it complied, standing back up. The Beasts Pirates were shocked and fearful to see this, and Zunesha decimated their entire fleet with a single swing of its trunk. Bariete reported that Jack's fleet was gone, and the people on Zou struggled to make sense of what happened. Nekomamushi stated that until they figured out how Jack navigated here, Zou would no longer be safe for them, and Luffy prepared to head off.

On a certain island in the  New World,  Scratchmen Apoo contacted Kaidou, saying that they had lost contact with Jack's fleet.

Later, Chopper, Miyagi, and some other minks rappelled down Zunesha's injured leg to bandage it up. Meanwhile, Momonosuke revealed to his retainers that he wanted to stay behind on Zou in order to communicate further with the elephant. Inuarashi said that he would stay behind with Momonosuke in order to maintain a defense on Zou while avoiding having everyone rush into Wano Country at once.

Meanwhile, Luffy saw with a shock that Pekoms' house was destroyed in the battle, but Pekoms revealed that he was fine due to his Devil Fruit, the  Kame Kame no Mi, giving him a hard tortoise shell. Luffy talked with Pekoms about their upcoming mission before carrying the mink on his back and rushing off, much to Pekoms' outrage. Meanwhile, Pedro asked Nekomamushi to accompany Luffy on the mission to rescue Sanji, and the ruler gave him permission. Wanda, Tristan, Blackback, Roddy,  Yomo, and several canine minks attempted to join in as well, but Nekomamushi left the mission to Pedro alone, as he could control Pekoms. Elsewhere, Usopp gave Nami an upgraded  Sorcery Clima-Tact with a greater mobility and range of abilities, but Nami skimped out on his fee. Finally, the newly formed  Sanji Retrieval Team prepared to head out, and Luffy grabbed everyone on the team and leaped off the elephant with them, ready to head to Whole Cake Island.

Meanwhile, an excited  Nefertari Vivi prepared to head out to sea with  her family.

#### The World Abuzz: Kings and Emperors on the Move[]

Nefertari Vivi and  Cobra set out to sea with their guards and staff, and Vivi climbed all around the ship as she embraced the life, she had left behind two years ago, which scared  Igaram. Cobra was in ailing health, and it was questioned whether he should even make the voyage, but he was intent on doing so, determined to ask the  World Government about the Poneglyphs when they reached their destination:  Levely.

Other rulers across the world prepared to head to Levely as well.  Sterry, the new king of  Goa Kingdom, and his wife  Sarie Nantokanette stayed in an inn in  Loguetown on their way. The ruler of  Kano Country lamented that the  Chinjao Family was unavailable to accompany him to Levely, and  Wapol headed there simply to find ways to make it hard for  Dalton. On  Drum Island, Dalton prepared to go as well, with  Kureha accompanying him as his doctor. The  Riku Family and  Mansherry prepared to head to Levely, with  Rebecca and  Elizabello II accompanying them. On  Fish-Man Island,  Neptune  and  his  sons begged a frightened  Shirahoshi to accompany them, as they were prepared to present Queen  Otohime's treaty to Levely.

Somewhere at sea, the members of the Sanji Retrieval Team could barely do their sailing work as they were still recovering from the jump off Zou. Suddenly, Carrot appeared in front of them, amazed by the big world around her. The Sanji Retrieval Team was less than enthusiastic about her, but she begged them to let her stay, and they relented. Right then, Pedro received a newspaper revealing that the headquarters of the Revolutionary Army on Baltigo had been discovered in a state of ruin.

Luffy was shocked to hear the news, though had not previously realized that the picture of the revolutionary leader Dragon was his father until his crew told him. However, Luffy was more worried for his brother  Sabo. They read that the base had been destroyed by  Blackbeard, who fled after briefly clashing with  Cipher Pol. However, Pedro noted that if Dragon or Sabo were captured or killed it would have certainly been reported, which calmed Luffy. Suddenly, the Thousand Sunny caught on fire due to Luffy leaving the stove on, and the crew struggled to navigate a fierce storm.

At Zou, Wanda talked to Bariete about Carrot's departure before telling Inuarashi that he should rest, but the ruler was preoccupied with wondering how Jack and his men got to Zou twice. Meanwhile, Jack rested underwater, still conscious and waiting for rescue. On a certain island, Kaidou received the report of Jack's defeat and became very emotional. Drinking heavily, Kaidou lamented the loss of his  SMILEs preventing him from creating a crew of all  Devil Fruit users. His subordinates stated that they should not take Luffy and Law's alliance lightly, but Kaidou blew them away in anger, saying that they were nowhere near his level and that they were only playing little pirates' games, whilst indicating to the defeated  Eustass Kid in a cell nearby.

Aboard the Thousand Sunny, calm returned as the crew sailed through a snowstorm. In Sanji's absence, Luffy cooked for the crew and presented them with his "random curry." However, it proved to be inedible, and the crew was outraged when they learned that he had used their entire rations to make it.

### __Whole Cake Island Arc__

#### Entering Totto Land: Big Mom's Unified Paradise[]

The  Big Mom Pirates reached their territory,  Totto Land, with  Sanji in tow. Sanji refused to accept his situation, although he became enamored with  Charlotte Pudding when  Vito gave him a picture of her. Vito then talked to Sanji about how he admired  Germa 66, who were portrayed as villains in the comic . Sanji blew off Vito, causing Vito's crewmate  Gotti to threaten Sanji, but  Bege's wife  Charlotte Chiffon prevented Gotti from harming Sanji.

Meanwhile, the  Sanji Retrieval Team was starving when  Luffy finally caught a fish. He immediately started eating it, but its skin turned out to be extremely poisonous and put him on the brink of death. The  Thousand Sunny then entered Totto Land and was soon confronted by a ship belonging to Germa 66. They were greeted by Sanji's brother,  Vinsmoke Yonji, and Yonji refused to help Luffy. However, his sister  Vinsmoke Reiju then attacked him and came to the Sunny, where she used her "" abilities to suck the poison out of Luffy's body. Reiju revealed that the upcoming marriage had been arranged by her father, who initially had trouble finding Sanji until his bounty poster had been updated. This caused Luffy to become antagonistic toward her and Yonji, but the two siblings decided to part ways peacefully with the  Straw Hats to avoid making a scene before the wedding.

On  Broc Coli Island,  Vinsmoke Ichiji and  Vinsmoke Niji led a Germa 66 army to help end a two-year war. They beat the side they were hired to fight against in just four hours, and after collecting their payment, they prepared to head to their brother's wedding.

The Sanji Retrieval Team arrived at  Cacao Island, and Luffy and  Chopper were awed as they saw that everything was made of chocolate.  Pekoms told the rest of the team how Totto Land was a place where all  races lived in harmony, and stayed on the ship as everyone else disembarked.  Pedro was greeted by a wolf  mink who recognized him, but he told the mink to not draw attention to him. Luffy and Chopper were then arrested after eating almost an entire building, but they were saved by the building's owner, Charlotte Pudding, who claimed that she had told them to demolish it. Pudding took the team to her cafe, and as she talked with them, Luffy inadvertently revealed who he was. Pudding then revealed who she was, and said that she had already met Sanji once; he still wished to rejoin his crew, and she accepted it and was willing to help the Straw Hats take him back, recalling one of her own sisters who left Totto Land to marry for love. Pudding mapped a secret route for the Sanji Retrieval Team to take to  Whole Cake Island, where she would be waiting with Sanji. The team then received chocolate rations from her before heading back to the Sunny, but discovered that Pekoms was nowhere to be seen and had left a message on the wall saying to turn back.

Meanwhile,  Aladine had spotted the Sunny from underwater and reported this to  Jinbe. Jinbe requested from  his crew that he break off from the Big Mom Pirates and join the Straw Hat Pirates, and they happily agreed, wanting him to make a decision benefiting himself for once. The Sun Pirates were prepared to flee should Jinbe's request to cut ties with  Big Mom go wrong, and Big Mom's daughter  Charlotte Praline was more than willing to accompany her husband Aladine wherever he went.

On Whole Cake Island, Big Mom sang and danced with anthropomorphic objects known as  homies as she received reports of her crew members massacring people to acquire ingredients for the wedding cake. She then looked forward to dealing with Luffy, who she already knew had arrived. However, Big Mom was later stricken by a craving for croquembouche, and her mental illness made her mindlessly violent as she attacked  Sweet City to find it. Her son,  Charlotte Moscato, attempted to intervene, but she  pulled out 40 years of his lifespan, causing the onlookers to pronounce him dead on the scene. As Big Mom neared her own castle, Jinbe then arrived and threw a pile of croquembouche tourists into her mouth, satiating her. Big Mom did not remember what she had done, and Jinbe asked to discuss something important with her. Big Mom took him to the  Whole Cake Chateau, and Jinbe asked to leave her crew. Big Mom seemingly accepted, but stated that Jinbe would have to spin a  roulette wheel to give something up in return. Realizing that the wheel would cause him to lose all of his remaining lifespan and threaten the lives of his comrades as well, Jinbe took back his request.

#### Big Mom's Soul Nation: Struggle in the Seducing Woods[]

The Sanji Retrieval Team sailed along Pudding's secret route, dealing with a variety of sea creatures and getting stuck in a syrupy ocean that froze over in the night. As they worked to free the Sunny, Pedro revealed that he was once a pirate who had sailed to Totto Land before, but had been defeated. Now, in addition to helping rescue Sanji, he also wished to help the Straw Hats acquire Big Mom's Road  Poneglyph, and told Luffy to leave that mission to him. The team reached Whole Cake Island the next morning, and Luffy spotted Sanji and Pudding standing on the coast. Pedro and  Brook went off on the  Shark Submerge III to find the Road Poneglyph, and the rest of the team disembarked, not seeing Sanji or Pudding anywhere. They entered the  Seducing Woods, where they were almost eaten by a homie called the  Noble Croc and encountered a  clone of Luffy. Luffy started fighting with his clone, who perfectly mirrored his words and actions, when the team spotted someone, they thought was Sanji. The Sanji lookalike ran away, and as  Nami, Chopper, and  Carrot chased him, they encountered a large man named  Pound buried in the ground and were attacked by a rabbit homie named  Randolph as the many homies of the Seducing Woods prepared to kill the Sanji Retrieval Team.

Nami, Chopper, and Carrot ran away from Randolph, and Carrot briefly clashed with the rabbit. They ended up by Pound again, and as they tried running back to the coast, they got back to Luffy still fighting with his reflection. However, they were accompanied by Luffy's reflection while the real Luffy was sent running the other way, and ended up going right back to Pound. The mirror version of Luffy then transformed into the eighth daughter of the  Charlotte Family,  Charlotte Brûlée, and Brûlée grabbed Nami as she prepared to scar her face. Nami managed to use her  Clima-Tact to free herself, but when Carrot tried attacking Brûlée, Brûlée reflected her attacks before sending her into an alternate dimension known as the  Mirro-World. Brûlée then had the homies in the Seducing Woods attack Chopper and Nami, and Chopper activated  to allow Nami to run away. Eventually, Chopper was overwhelmed and sent to the Mirro-World as well.

Meanwhile, Luffy captured several animals that Brûlée had turned into mirror duplicates of his comrades, including Sanji and Pudding. As night fell, he realized that he had captured the real Nami, and after freeing her, they talked with Pound, who revealed how Brûlée had created the disguised animals and what had happened to Chopper. Pound then told them how homies were created by scattering a month's worth of lifespan given by the citizens of Totto Land every six months as a tribute, as Big Mom was able to remove lifespans with the power of her  Devil Fruit. Pound then revealed that he was once one of Big Mom's husbands, but had been cast aside after giving her twin daughters. Right then,  Charlotte Cracker, the tenth son of the Charlotte Family and one of the Big Mom Pirates'  Three Sweet Commanders, pulled Pound out of the ground and prepared to kill him for giving information to their enemies. Pound pleaded with Cracker to let him see his daughters, Chiffon and  Lola, before he died.

Nami realized that Lola was Big Mom's daughter and the sister that Pudding mentioned, and when Randolph attempted to attack her and Luffy, Cracker blew him and the other homies away with just his voice. Cracker stated he had come to deal with Luffy's group to eliminate them before the  Vinsmokes all arrived, much to the chagrin of Brûlée and the homie  Kingbaum. Cracker prepared to kill Pound first, but Luffy blocked his sword strike, and the homies ran in fear from the powerful clash. Nami and Pound ran away and were chased by Brûlée and the homies, but Nami pulled out the  Vivre Card Lola gave her, and her suspicions were confirmed as the homies were repelled by the soul of Big Mom in the card. However, Cracker quickly overpowered Luffy, and Brûlée confronted Nami, saying they would have no chance of getting anywhere close to Sanji or Big Mom. Brûlée then attempted to grab Nami and pull her into the Mirro-World, but Pound attacked his ex-stepdaughter, allowing Nami to strike Brûlée with . Nami then decided to take advantage of the card's power against the homies by forcing them to serve her.

Luffy continued fighting Cracker, but was unable to injure the Sweet Commander even with  and . Cracker spawned additional limbs on his body and created copies of his sword and shield, allowing him to overpower Luffy. However, when Cracker stated that Sanji would not want to return to the Straw Hats, an enraged Luffy activated  and successfully injured him with . However, as Luffy split Cracker's body in half with additional attacks, the real Cracker leaped out and cut him in the arm, injuring him. Cracker revealed that he was operating in a biscuit body crafted by the  Bisu Bisu no Mi, and created more biscuit bodies that shielded him and allowed him to gain an edge offensively.

Brook and Pedro infiltrated Sweet City, where they read the news about Jinbe and, to their surprise, found Pudding being forced to try on wedding dresses. They then overheard from  Tamago that the Big Mom Pirates knew the locations of everyone in the Sanji Retrieval Team except for the two of them. At the northwestern coast of Whole Cake Island, Capone Bege and the  Fire Tank Pirates brought a captured Pekoms to the edge of a cliff. Bege had offered Pekoms the chance to join him in his plot to assassinate Big Mom, but Pekoms refused, and the lion mink told Bege to not underestimate Big Mom before being shot into shark-infested waters. However, Pekoms was swiftly rescued by members of the Sun Pirates. In the Whole Cake Chateau, Big Mom talked to  Caesar about her job and asked him to find a way to turn her children into  giants like her. Caesar had long ago realized that  gigantification was impossible and so blew all the money Big Mom invested in the project, and to protect himself, he claimed that his research had been halted by Luffy and  Law for destroying his lab. Big Mom then revealed that she had her eldest son  Charlotte Perospero create a perfect replica of his lab out of candy with the power of the  Pero Pero no Mi, and gave Caesar two weeks to complete his research, or else Perospero would turn him into candy and kill him.

#### A Family Reunion: Sanji's Loyalties Tested[]

At Lake Aprico behind the Whole Cake Chateau, several Germa ships docked together to form the mobile  Germa Kingdom. There, Sanji had reunited with Yonji and beaten him up after Yonji tried bossing him around. Reiju then asked Sanji why he did not accept the new lifestyle offered to him, but Sanji continued expressing his disgust with his family. Sanji's father,  Vinsmoke Judge, then arrived and tried talking to his estranged son about the incident with Yonji, but Sanji treated him coldly as well, causing him to take Sanji outside to settle matters physically. As they started to fight, Sanji demonstrated his abilities to be on par with Judge's, and remembered how his father allowed his brothers to bully him mercilessly. Sanji went on the offensive, but Judge had Germa soldiers form a wall in front of him, preventing Sanji from attacking while allowing him to penetrate one of the soldiers with his spear and hit Sanji with an electric discharge from the tip. Afterwards, Reiju treated Sanji's wounds, and Judge told Sanji that he no longer considered him a son and had brought him for the arranged marriage because he considered Big Mom to be a psychopath. To ensure Sanji's cooperation, Judge had Reiju put exploding cuffs on his wrists, which would explode and destroy his hands if he attempted to escape.

The next morning, Ichiji and Niji arrived at the Germa Kingdom, and the Vinsmoke Family had a meal together. There, Sanji was angered when Niji scraped some of his food onto the floor and attempted to throw his plate at the head chef,  Cosette. However, Sanji was prevented from acting further by Judge, who revealed that Germa had sent assassins to the  East Blue who would take out  Zeff upon command. After the meal, Sanji discovered that Cosette had been brutally beaten, and Yonji offered to take him to see Niji. Yonji took Sanji to a laboratory where Germa grew its clone soldiers, and Sanji was then confronted by Niji and Ichiji. Sanji attacked Niji, but was quickly overpowered by his three brothers and left injured in the laboratory.

Sanji remembered growing up in the Germa Kingdom, where his father Judge had him and his siblings train to unlock special  superhuman modifications. However, Sanji constantly fell behind in all the exercises, and was brutally bullied by his brothers as a result. Sanji's compassionate activities such as cooking were put a stop to, and although Sanji's mother,  Sora, encouraged these activities, she eventually died. After finding out that Sanji appeared to be a normal human without a trace of modifications in his body, the judge had Sanji locked away in a dungeon and had his death faked. Although he had to wear an iron mask, Sanji was fed in his cell and was able to study, but was eventually found by his brothers who started bullying him again. Eventually, Reiju told Sanji that the Germa Kingdom was heading to the East Blue, and that this would be his best chance to escape. When Germa came to the East Blue and invaded the island  Cozia, Reiju freed Sanji and told him to head to freedom on a nearby ship. Sanji encountered Judge, who allowed him to run away so long as he never associated himself with the Vinsmoke Family again, and he ran crying to the ship  Orbit, where he embarked on his journey to freedom.

In the present, Reiju found Sanji in the laboratory and took him to fix his face in preparation for lunch with Big Mom and Pudding. She put a mask on over his face that made it look normal, and asked him why he acted so chivalrously. Sanji revealed that he learned it from Zeff, who was the only man to consider him a son. Sanji then headed out with his family to go to the banquet at the Whole Cake Chateau.

Back in the Seducing Woods, Luffy's fight against Cracker lasted for eleven hours. With the protection of her enslaved homies, Nami created rain clouds to soften Cracker's Biscuit Soldiers, allowing Luffy to eat them. After eating the soldiers, Luffy ran away before coming back and repeating this over and over. Luffy's body was so full it threatened to burst, but his efforts managed to fatigue Cracker. Eventually, after Luffy continued eating even more Biscuit Soldiers, Cracker snapped and charged in to finish Luffy off himself. However, Luffy then activated a form of  known as  Tankman: Manpuku Version, and he absorbed Cracker into his body before shooting him out, sending him crashing through his Biscuit Soldiers and the trees all the way to Sweet City, where he was discovered by his siblings  Opera,  Mont-d'Or, and  Galette. Shocked by his defeat, they raised a state of emergency in the city. Pound, who had run away during the battle, returned and warned Luffy that Big Mom's wrath would be unleashed upon Luffy now, recalling how in the past she had sent her weapons  Zeus and  Prometheus to create a storm before sending Cracker to avenge the former Sweet Commander  Snack, who had been beaten by the  Supernova  Urouge. However, Luffy had no choice but to continue saving Sanji, and he and Nami forced Kingbaum to take them out of the Seducing Woods.

Meanwhile, Chopper and Carrot found themselves in the Mirro-World, and Chopper told Carrot to follow his lead as he sought to use the mirrors connected to Whole Cake Island to their advantage. However, they were soon chased by Brûlée, and they briefly got in contact with Luffy and Nami with a mirror shard before it was shattered. Brûlée eventually captured them, but accidentally turned a frog into the mirror image of Carrot and captured the frog. She brought Chopper and the frog to her house and prepared to cook the latter, and Carrot hid in the attic. Guests gathered at Brûlée's house, among them being Randolph, the Noble Croc, and  Diesel. When the party prepared to cook the frog, Carrot climbed down on the rope holding her duplicate and kicked over the giant pot of boiling water onto Brûlée. She and Chopper then quickly defeated the rest of the guests, and captured Brûlée and Diesel to guide them through the Mirro-World.

After leaving the woods, Luffy's group reached a clearing where they immediately ran into the carriage containing Sanji and the Vinsmokes. Luffy became excited as he ran toward Sanji, but Sanji kicked him away. With the threat against Zeff hanging over him, Sanji claimed that he had rejected the Straw Hats in favor of his royal heritage, and he attacked Luffy, who refused to accept this but also would not lay a hand on him. After defeating Luffy, Sanji returned to his carriage, but Luffy proclaimed that he would wait in this clearing and would not eat anything until Sanji came back.

The Vinsmokes' carriage then arrived at Sweet City and the Whole Cake Chateau, and Sanji and his family watched as a massive army headed out to take down Luffy and avenge Cracker. The Vinsmokes went inside and began their lunch with Big Mom and Pudding, and Pudding told Sanji to meet her in private. There, Pudding confided that she had failed to help Sanji return to his crewmates and apologized for putting him in this situation, but Sanji declared that he had accepted his situation. Having decided to make the best of what he was given, he decided to get married to Pudding the next day. After this, Sanji went to Big Mom and made an agreement that she release his crewmates in return for his willing participation in the wedding.

#### The Truth About the Wedding: Race to a Reunion[]

Meanwhile, Zeus and Prometheus created a storm on the outskirts of Sweet City, and Big Mom's enraged army arrived to battle Luffy. Although Luffy's group managed to take down many of the  Chess Soldiers with the help of Nami's Vivre Card, Luffy was eventually overwhelmed by the vast array of Devil Fruit users, and Nami was immobilized by Galette's  ability. Luffy was then knocked out by  Counter and  Cadenza's punches, and after she had killed Kingbaum by slicing him in two,  Amande took Nami's Vivre Card from her. The Big Mom Pirates then took Luffy and Nami to the Whole Cake Chateau, where they were imprisoned in a book in the Prisoner Library.

Big Mom took the Vinsmoke Family save Sanji to another part of her library, where she kept a large variety of rare species. Judge noted that he had not seen any giants in Totto Land, and Big Mom was briefly angered, but then said that he must have just missed them. Big Mom then went to contact Luffy and Nami, and Lola's Vivre Card. Big Mom revealed that she wished to kill Lola for ruining a political marriage that could have let her become the  Pirate King. However, Luffy was unfazed by Big Mom and challenged her, arousing her wrath. After the call, Pudding then came to the library and entered Luffy and Nami's cell. She told them that she would not be marrying Sanji, revealing to them in secret that she would murder him during the wedding. As she said this, she revealed a  third eye on her forehead, and she also revealed that Big Mom would also renege on her agreement to spare the rest of the Sanji Retrieval Team. This left Luffy and Nami completely aghast, although they were unable to do anything.

Soon afterwards, Pudding shot Reiju, who was snooping around the Chateau, in the leg. Reiju initially managed to keep moving, but was eventually captured and taken to Pudding's room. There, Pudding revealed that the Big Mom Pirates planned to massacre the Vinsmoke Family with special  Walkers whose bullets could pierce through the Vinsmokes' exoskeletons. Sanji had made a meal for Pudding to make up for her not eating lunch, and after being unable to get through her door, he snuck around to her window where he overheard her revealing the plan, leaving him in despair. Pudding then used  her Devil Fruit to remove Reiju's memories of their encounter and sent her to the infirmary. Sanji went to the infirmary and told Reiju what had happened, and she believed him. She urged him to run away, saying that the rest of the family's lives were worthless. She revealed that their mother Sora opposed Judge's wishes for their sons' emotions to be suppressed, but was forced to undergo a surgery to insert these modifications into the unborn sons. Afterwards, Sora took a drug in the hopes of reversing these modifications, and the drug weakened her to the point where she eventually died. The drug worked on Sanji alone, and Reiju urged him to keep living as Germa's failure.

In the Whole Cake Chateau's Room of Treasure, Sweet Commander  Charlotte Smoothie was stationed to guard Big Mom's Poneglyphs along with Tamago and several other fighters. Brook spies into the room with his soul projection and sees the security, and he and Pedro decide that Pedro will provide a distraction. Pedro created a ruckus outside the room, causing Tamago and some of Big Mom's forces to pursue him. This caused Smoothie to be lured out of the room and locked out by Brook, who confronted the forces still inside and swiftly overwhelmed the homies with his  Yomi Yomi no Mi abilities. Big Mom then received a signal from her hat  Napoleon that there was an intruder in the Room of Treasure, and as Brook was copying down the Poneglyphs after having taken all the guards out, she barged into the room and confronted him.

Tamago and his subordinates chased Pedro to a courtyard, where Tamago and Pedro dueled for the first time since five years ago, when Pedro had taken Tamago's eye. Pedro remembered his voyage into Totto Land five years ago, where after his defeat he and his comrade  Zepo were forced to spin Big Mom's roulette wheel to see what lifespan they would lose. They landed on 100 years, and Zepo was killed after having 30 years removed. However, Pekoms, who had recently joined Big Mom, pleaded for her to spare Pedro, and Pedro earned her respect by removing his right eye, causing the remaining 70 years to be shaved to 50 and allowing him to survive. With not much lifespan left, Pedro was willing to die here to help the Straw Hats. During the battle, however, Chopper and Carrot found Pedro, and they devised a plan for Pedro to escape into the Mirro-World. Pedro managed to bisect Tamago, only for the Baron to use his  Devil Fruit abilities to regenerate into a stronger form called Viscount Hiyoko. Pedro managed to bisect Hiyoko as well, and before Hiyoko regenerated into his final form, the "true knight" Count Niwatori, Pedro blew up the courtyard in what appeared to be a suicide attack. However, he managed to escape into the Mirro-World right after setting off the explosion.

In the Prisoner Library, Luffy tried twisting against his binding in order to rip his hands off and escape. Opera then prepared to torture Nami to get her to reveal Lola's location, but before he could, Jinbe entered the library and knocked him out with . Jinbe then burned the books, freeing Luffy and Nami. Luffy then ran on ahead to find Sanji, and he was pulled into Reiju's room. Reiju told Luffy that Sanji knew about Pudding's treachery and that he was trapped by threats against Zeff, and Luffy thanked her before jumping out the window onto the streets below. Smoothie heard about the breakout, and to avoid Big Mom's wrath, she had her forces seal off the fourth floor and attack the escapees without letting Big Mom know. Nami and Jinbe battled Big Mom's forces in the Chateau until they were reunited with Chopper and Carrot and brought into the Mirro-World. Elsewhere in the Chateau, the Big Mom Pirates met to discuss the fates of the Sanji Retrieval Team. Count Niwatori, who had survived Pedro's explosion, reported Pedro as dead. The crew assumed that Brûlée had dealt with Chopper and Carrot, and Opera then lied that Luffy and Nami had died in order to protect himself from Big Mom's wrath. Due to an  Eggplant Soldier sleeping in Sanji's bed, the Big Mom Pirates were unaware that Sanji was unaccounted for.

In the Room of Treasure, Brook was overwhelmed by Big Mom's power, but refused to go down. Eventually, he was defeated, and after not finding any copies of the Poneglyphs on him, Big Mom decided to keep him as a pet. Although Brook could not overpower her homies Zeus, Prometheus, and Napoleon due to them being made from her own soul, he was capable of giving Prometheus a small wound. Pudding then entered the room and asked to speak with Big Mom. Pudding and Big Mom went over the plan to assassinate the Vinsmokes in the throne room, with Brook overhearing it. In the Mirro-World, Nami, Chopper, Jinbe, Pedro, and Carrot, along with Brûlée and Diesel, searched for Brook, and they eventually found Big Mom sleeping with him. After multiple attempts and barely escaping Big Mom's power, they successfully rescued Brook and brought him back to the Mirro-World. There, Brook revealed that he had copied all of the Poneglyphs and stored them in his skull, and the team celebrated before going to look for Luffy and Sanji.

Sanji remained in the Chateau, and despite Reiju's encouragement, he resigned himself to death.  Bobbin then came up to him and took a piece of food out of the bento box that Sanji had made for Pudding. In an instant, Sanji kicked him into the wall, and was immediately forced to run away. Sanji escaped to Sweet City with Bobbin in hot pursuit, but he made it to the outskirts of the city while Bobbin was shot by the Fire Tank Pirates. Sanji found Luffy at the promised spot, with his captain incapacitated from hunger. Luffy ate Sanji's bento and found it delicious even though it was ruined, but Sanji then told him that he would not be rejoining the crew. However, Luffy punched him and told him to say what he really felt, and Sanji admitted that he wanted to save his family from assassination. Upon hearing this, Luffy immediately agreed to help in the endeavor. The rest of the Sanji Retrieval Team then got in contact with Luffy and Sanji, and upon hearing their new objective, Jinbe suggested proposing an alliance to Bege, who was aiming to assassinate Big Mom during the wedding. Luffy and Bege both agreed to Jinbe's proposition.

#### Crashing the Wedding: Alliance With the Fire Tank Pirates[]

In the Whole Cake Chateau, the Vinsmokes partied and drank heavily, looking forward to the wedding. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats arrived at the Fire Tank Pirates' hideout and were forced to bathe before meeting with Bege. While in the bath, Nami and Carrot spoke with Chiffon, who revealed that Lola had turned down a marriage proposal from  Prince  Loki of  Elbaf. Due to her resemblance to Lola, Chiffon had been abused by Big Mom after the marriage's failure, and she now had no problem with her husband trying to kill her mother. The two crews then met, and although things got off to a rocky start due to Luffy being angry at Bege for shooting Pekoms, a collaborative plan was set. Bege had recruited Caesar Clown to his side after being put on guard duty at the latter's lab, and had gained  KX Launchers that would instantly kill anyone upon penetrating their skin. However, Big Mom had skin as hard as iron, but Bege knew how she could become weak. At every tea party, Big Mom brought out a portrait of a mysterious woman named Mother  Carmel. Recently, someone had accidentally cracked it, which had caused Big Mom to enter a psychological crisis, and during this crisis she scraped her knees upon falling to the ground. Bege gave Luffy the task of destroying the portrait, and Luffy accepted despite the heavy risk.

After the meeting, Luffy got an idea to enter the wedding and requested that Bege have a mirror be placed in the wedding cake. He then went and gathered several animals and told Brûlée to turn them into reflections of himself. At an inlet on Whole Cake Island, the Sun Pirates treated Pekoms' wounds, but did not tell him what Jinbe was plotting. They then tied him up as they departed from Whole Cake Island the morning of the wedding.

As morning broke, the  Underworld Emperors who were invited to the wedding arrived on Whole Cake Island, with the conglomerate member  Du Feld, the queen of the Pleasure District  Stussy, and the reporter for the  World Economic Journal  Morgans among them. They went to the wedding venue at the top of the Whole Cake Chateau, where Bege stood guard. A man named  Jigra attempted to get in, but was shot by Sweet Commander  Charlotte Katakuri. Katakuri, whose  Kenbunshoku Haki was so advanced it allowed him to see into the future, had foreseen that Jigra had been attempting to attack Big Mom. At 10:00 AM, Big Mom entered the venue, and the tea party festivities began. Big Mom was presented with presents from her Underworld guests, and revealed that she planned to open the  Tamatebako that she received from  Fish-Man Island as well. With everyone in the venue, Caesar remained outside while Bege took the Sanji Retrieval Team in to initiate their plan.

Inside the Chateau, Pudding changed into her wedding dress and prepared to have to modify everyone's memories after the assassination. Sanji returned to the Chateau and soon joined Pudding, and as Pudding continued with her facade, Sanji struggled to remind himself of her true intentions despite her looks. The two of them were then brought out to the venue, and inside Bege's body, Jinbe desperately tried to wake Luffy up as the time for his entrance was soon. Pudding and Sanji stood before the altar, and when the time came for Pudding to lift her veil, she did so intending for Sanji to be shocked by her third eye. However, Sanji called her beautiful, shocking Pudding and causing her to break down as she remembered being bullied for her appearance as a child. With this development, both the priest and Katakuri moved to shoot Sanji, but Sanji dodged Katakuri's shot, and it hit the priest, causing his gun to go off. With the sound of a gunshot being his cue, Luffy and his animal duplicates then burst out of the wedding cake.

Luffy's entrance caused chaos to erupt in the venue, and Big Mom began to go crazy at the destruction of the wedding cake. Katakuri found the real Luffy and attacked him with his  Mochi Mochi no Mi abilities. However, Jinbe freed Luffy from Katakuri's mochi and spoke to Big Mom, declaring that he wished to leave her crew. He was willing to have Big Mom take his lifespan so long as she did not harm any of his comrades, and Big Mom tried to do so, but found herself unable to due to Jinbe lacking fear. She then attacked Jinbe and Luffy, but as she did this, Brook, who had disguised himself as Luffy, went up to the Carmel portrait and destroyed it. However, Big Mom did not enter a crisis due to being overwhelmed by the destruction of the cake. Pudding attempted to complete her job and shoot Sanji, but was hit out of the way by her brother  Charlotte Daifuku, who  summoned a genie that briefly overpowered Sanji. Meanwhile, Pedro was confronted by  Charlotte Oven, who used his  Netsu Netsu no Mi abilities to heat up his sword and prevent him from holding it. Meanwhile, the Vinsmokes were bound by Perospero's candy and held at gunpoint, and were unable to escape due to not wearing their  Raid Suits. Judge wept as he was left aghast by the Big Mom Pirates' treachery, while his sons showed no emotion at all and Reiju accepted their fate.

Bege pretended to go after Luffy, and Brook went to them to tell them to show Big Mom the pieces of the Carmel portrait. Katakuri then confronted them, and Bege shot the Sweet Commander to give Luffy time. Katakuri avoided various attacks from the enemy alliance as he pursued Luffy, but subdued Luffy too late as Luffy stretched his arms in front of Big Mom's face, showing her the portrait pieces. Big Mom then entered a crisis, unleashing  Haoshoku Haki that knocked out several guests and a scream that immobilized everyone else. The  Straw Hat-Fire Tank Alliance members put on earplugs, and with the assassins incapacitated, Sanji freed his family from their bindings as they were given earplugs as well. As she screamed, Big Mom despaired over Mother Carmel, wanting to know where she had gone.

#### The Wedding Becomes Chaos: Going After the Emperor's Head[]

63 years ago, a 5-year-old Charlotte Linlin had been abandoned on Elbaf by her parents after causing too much destruction in her hometown. Her parents hoped that Mother Carmel would take her into the  Sheep's House, and Linlin indeed found a home in the orphanage where children of all races were raised. Carmel, who had ushered in a new era of human-giant relations after pleading for the lives of the  Giant Warrior Pirates to be spared, was patient with Linlin's obliviousness that led to violent tendencies, but never taught her to curb these tendencies. One day, Linlin and the Sheep's House took part in a  semla feast prior to a 12-day fasting period for the  Winter Solstice Festival, but Linlin loved the semla so much she had to be restrained before she could eat it all. Linlin greatly struggled during the ensuing fast, and by the seventh day, she had snapped and gone on a crazed rampage for semla. One of the oldest giants in the village,  Jorul, attempted to kill her for her actions, but Linlin threw him to the ground and gave him fatal injuries. Linlin was then given semla, and Carmel pleaded for the giants to spare her. They agreed, but on the condition that Linlin leave the island, and so Carmel took the Sheep's House to a new island.

Life resumed as normal on the new island, and one day, Carmel met with agents from the  World Government. Working as an Underworld trafficker named "Mountain Witch," Carmel operated the Sheep's House to sell recruits for the  Marines and  Cipher Pol under the guise of adoption. She sold Linlin for a hefty price, and prepared to retire once Linlin was gone. Soon afterwards, the Sheep's House celebrated Linlin's sixth birthday, and they made a croquembouche of semla for her. An overjoyed Big Mom rapidly consumed the croquembouche, oblivious to everything else around her, but after finishing her meal, she looked to see that Carmel and the Sheep's House children were all gone. Two people witnessed this event: a giant, whose report of it to Elbaf caused the giants to hate Linlin even more, and a man named  Streusen, a failed pirate and chef who was captivated by what he saw. Streusen approached the distressed Linlin and offered to feed her with his  Kuku Kuku no Mi powers if he joined her, and in the years that followed, Linlin became a terrorizing pirate who quickly earned high bounties and could not be stopped by anyone. Linlin and Streusen also worked on turning the island they first met on into a place where everyone could live in harmony, as Linlin had inherited this dream from Carmel, although she misinterpreted it to believe that everyone should be the same size as her.

In the present, Vito and Gotti exited Bege's body and the trio shot their KX Launchers at Big Mom. However, in her anguish, she unleashed a powerful scream that blew up the missiles in midair. As Katakuri created mochi earplugs to protect his crewmates from Big Mom's scream, the Fire Tank-Straw Hat alliance's mission ended in failure, and they were left with no choice but to run away. Caesar flew in with Brûlée and a mirror for the alliance to escape through, but Big Mom's scream shattered the mirror, leaving the alliance trapped. Bege then transformed into a giant humanoid castle known as  and told the alliance members to get inside him. Katakuri rescued Brûlée and Smoothie, Daifuku, and Oven captured Nami, Carrot, and Chopper respectively. However, after regaining their Raid Suits, the Vinsmokes put them on and attacked the Big Mom Pirates, freeing Nami, Carrot, and Chopper. They then joined the alliance inside Bege, and he attempted to kill Big Mom, but was stopped by Perospero and Katakuri and besieged. Big Mom then regained her senses and started attacking Bege, with her punches strong enough to damage him. The alliance tried to think of a way to escape, and they considered having Caesar fly Bege out of the venue, although this was extremely risky. Meanwhile, Sanji talked with Judge, and made it clear that he would no longer be associated with the Vinsmokes. Judge agreed to never go near him, or the East Blue again, and then took his other children toward the exit as they prepared to repay their debt by giving backup to Caesar and Bege.

When the Vinsmokes and Caesar exited him, Bege transformed into his normal body and was carried away by Caesar as the Vinsmokes shielded them from the Big Mom Pirates' bullets. However, Big Mom began attacking and injured Reiju with Prometheus, but before she could finish her off, Sanji and Luffy came out and intercepted her strike. Sanji wanted to escape immediately afterwards, but Luffy clashed with Big Mom again, telling her that he would return and beat her after  Kaidou. Judge then came to confront Big Mom, but she swiftly took him down, followed by Niji and Yonji. Ichiji was beaten by Katakuri and Sanji, Luffy, and Reiju were subdued by the Big Mom Pirates, leaving Caesar and Bege helpless. Meanwhile, Du Feld had gone to the Tamatebako to try to steal its contents. After accidentally dropping it onto a ledge below, he went down to get it, but ended up being shot by Stussy, who was revealed to be a  CP0 agent. However, his incapacitated body pushed the Tamatebako off the ledge, and it fell all the way to the ground and exploded, which damaged the base of the Whole Cake Chateau and caused it to start tipping over.

Sanji and Caesar flew their allies to safety, parting ways with the Vinsmokes, while the Big Mom Pirates fell to the ground far below. However, Streusen turned part of the Chateau into soft cake, cushioning the fall. The Straw Hat-Fire Tank alliance went to the northwest part of Whole Cake Island, and Caesar left after getting his heart back while the Straw Hats and Fire Tank Pirates parted ways. Back in Sweet City, the Big Mom Pirates planned to pursue their enemies, but Big Mom started craving her ruined wedding cake and went on a mad rampage, removing Opera's lifespan in the process. Perospero lied that there was a second wedding cake that the Straw Hats had stolen, and Big Mom believed him, but said she would kill him if he was lying, causing him to panic. Pudding then arrived and told her crew that she could make another wedding cake with the rare ingredients left over on Cacao Island and with the help of her sister Chiffon. She told them that she wanted to make the cake to get revenge on Sanji, but when she found Chiffon and the Fire Tank Pirates, she told Chiffon that she wanted to make it to help Sanji, and wanted to enlist him in the effort. Chiffon agreed to help Pudding, as she wanted to repay Nami for helping Lola, and they flew to Sanji on the carpet homie  Rabiyan.

#### Escaping the Wedding: Big Mom's Unstoppable Craving[]

Chopper and Brook headed off on their own to retrieve the Shark Submerge, and as the rest of the Straw Hat group approached the Seducing Woods, they found Kingbaum who had been resurrected. Nami used a part of Lola's Vivre Card that she had torn off and retained to force him to take them into the woods, but Big Mom then flew in behind them on Zeus looking for her wedding cake. She had Napoleon turn into a sword and unleashed devastating attacks at the Straw Hats, but Nami got an idea and fed Zeus some thundercloud balls. Zeus loved the clouds and stopped to eat them, causing Big Mom to fall off of him. However, Prometheus incinerated Kingbaum, and the Seducing Woods homies attacked as well, as Big Mom nullified the power of Lola's Vivre Card. Additionally, some of Big Mom's crew arrived to back her up, but Jinbe weakened Prometheus with  Fish-Man Karate, and while Nami was distracted, Zeus ate her entire . This caused him to swell up with storm energy, and Nami forced him to discharge, hitting Big Mom and her crew with a massive lightning bolt. Big Mom was left in a crater, but was still conscious and continued chasing the Straw Hats. Pudding and Chiffon then flew in to recruit Sanji to their cake baking operation, and Sanji agreed to it. Pudding then used her ability to restore the Seducing Woods homies' memories of their past lives, leaving them confused and overwhelmed and clearing a path to the Sunny.

Katakuri and Perospero took thousands of Chess Soldiers through the Mirro-World to occupy the Sunny, and they were met by Chopper and Brook from the Submerge. Perospero offered to let the duo run away, but they refused to abandon the ship and took down dozens of Chess Soldiers. Perospero then encased them in candy, leaving them three minutes until they suffocated. The Straw Hats then emerged onto the beach with Big Mom on their tail, and Perospero and Katakuri confronted them. Luffy clashed with Katakuri, but Perospero trapped the Sunny in candy as the Big Mom Pirates' fleet besieged it, leaving the Straw Hats trapped. Pedro then attempted to attack Perospero, but was overwhelmed. However, he then lit up several bombs in his jacket, engulfing him and Perospero in a massive explosion. Perospero survived, but received heavy injuries that left him unable to maintain his candy creations, thus freeing the Sunny, Chopper, and Brook. The Straw Hats prepared to escape with , and to prevent him from going after his crew, Luffy grabbed Katakuri before grabbing Brûlée, who had been watching from a nearby mirror. He pulled himself and Katakuri into the Mirro-World as the rest of the group activated , blasting them away from Whole Cake Island.

The Sunny crew mourned Pedro's death, but could not do so for long as Big Mom and her fleet quickly caught up to them. In the Mirro-World, Luffy began fighting Katakuri, but Katakuri used his mochi powers to mimic Luffy's abilities and overwhelm him. Brûlée and her subordinates then prepared to attack the Sunny through its mirrors, and after Katakuri prevented him from stopping them, Luffy contacted his crew through a mirror shard and told them to shatter all of the ship's mirrors and planned to meet back up with everyone on Cacao Island. The Sunny crew was attacked by a giant wave created by Big Mom, but Jinbe singlehandedly piloted the ship through the inside of the wave, successfully riding it out and escaping from Big Mom once again. The crew then shattered their mirrors, and everyone thought the Sunny had sunk, but Brûlée overheard Luffy talking to his crew and realized they were still alive, causing her to contact Perospero.

#### Cooking Up a Solution: The Sanji Retrieval Team's Last Stand[]

On Whole Cake Island, Mont-d'Or received a report from  Custard that the Fire Tank Pirates had escaped. Meanwhile, the Vinsmokes defeated the 10,000-strong army of Big Mom Pirates sent to take them down, and Niji impersonated one of them to trick Mont-d'Or into thinking that the Big Mom Pirates were victorious. The Big Mom Pirates were unable to track the locations of the Fire Tank and Straw Hat crews, however, as the Sun Pirates had stuck around Totto Land and Praline had distracted the  Territorial Sea Slugs by singing. Near Mont-d'Or, Pekoms cried over Pedro's death. Hours later, Stussy and Morgans joined Mont-d'Or's group and revealed to him that the Tamatebako caused the explosion that tipped over the Chateau. They then wondered if the Straw Hats would escape from Totto Land, but Mont-d'Or assured them no such thing would happen.

Luffy continued fighting Katakuri in the Mirro-World, but Katakuri used his advanced Kenbunshoku Haki to dodge all of Luffy's attacks and overwhelmed Luffy offensively. Luffy was even more overwhelmed when Katakuri brought out his trident  Mogura, but worked to dodge Mogura's deadly strikes and managed to stay in the fight. Brûlée told Luffy he had no chance of beating Katakuri, saying that Katakuri had never laid on his back since he was born. Katakuri became annoyed as his merienda was made late, and he stopped Luffy from entering  before burying him in a pile of mochi. Some chefs then brought out sweet treats, and Katakuri created a mochi house to consume them in private. However, Luffy ate his way out of the mochi pile and broke into Katakuri's house, where he saw Katakuri laying on his back and eating donuts with his large mouth. Upon seeing Luffy, Katakuri flew into a rage and attacked his chefs, but Luffy activated  and managed to hit Katakuri for the first time. As he assaulted Katakuri, Luffy realized that the Sweet Commander used his Kenbunshoku Haki to move his mochi body out of harm's way, and was defenseless now that he had lost his composure. However, Katakuri regained his composure and started dodging attacks again, and Luffy was quickly back at a disadvantage as Katakuri assaulted him with powerful attacks. However, Katakuri accidentally revealed that Gear 4 would wear off soon, allowing Luffy to run away from him. Luffy then ran into Brûlée, and took her through a mirror into the real world.

Perospero took Big Mom to Cacao Island to eat the wedding cake, but to his horror, she decided to go to  Nuts Island instead and destroyed everything in her path as she looked for cake. Luffy and Brûlée arrived on Nuts Island through the mirror, and ended up right in front of the rampaging Big Mom. Perospero pointed her to Luffy, and Luffy was forced to run away while still being unable to use  Haki. Eventually, Luffy took Brûlée inside a mirror, and the two of them visited several islands before eventually ending up in an empty house. As he waited to regain his Haki, Luffy remembered  Silvers Rayleigh teaching him that Haki could be strengthened by battling opponents with strong Haki. This made him decide to use the fight against Katakuri to improve his own Haki.

Meanwhile, as Pudding, Chiffon, and Sanji flew toward Cacao Island, they were spotted by Pound from a boat below, and he recognized his daughter Chiffon. Upon reaching Cacao Island, they were greeted by Whole Cake Island's top chefs the  WCI 31, who had been enlisted to help. Pudding altered their memories, making them believe that there was no fighting and Sanji had gotten married to her, and the team got to work making a cake in three hours, with Chiffon making the base chiffon cake, Pudding making the chocolate icing, and Sanji making a special whipped cream. As they were working, Pound unsuccessfully attempted to get into the Sweets Factory to see Chiffon. Oven then arrived on Cacao Island, and after seeing Pound making a commotion, he beat him up and threw him out. Inside the factory, Sanji finished his cream, which was so sweet it made people nearly die from happiness. With the parts of the cake finished baking, Sanji decided to set sail and construct the cake on the way to the Sunny.

The cake baking team headed out with the cake, and Sanji hid as Oven greeted them. He allowed Pudding to go on, but attacked Chiffon for being complicit in Bege's assassination attempt. Pound then tried to save his daughter, and Sanji took the opportunity to attack Oven and rescue Chiffon without being spotted. However, Oven quickly found Chiffon and confronted her again, and as he prepared to execute her, he got in contact with Bege who was heading for Cacao Island. Bege said he would stand down, but as his ship the  Nostra Castello got closer to the island, he shot Oven in the face. The Nostra Castello then used its tank treads to move on land, and Sanji brought the cake onboard as Chiffon was reunited with her family and crew. Bege took the Nostra Castello back to the sea, but the ship and cake were then threatened as Oven boiled the ocean. However, Pound attacked Oven again, giving the pirates and chefs time to escape while Oven turned to confront him, and before he was struck down by a flaming  naginata, Pound congratulated Chiffon on her marriage.

Meanwhile, Big Mom and her fleet found and pursued the Sunny crew again, and Daifuku arrived with another fleet to surround the Sunny. However, after seeing the full moon in the sky, Carrot told the crew to leave Daifuku's fleet to her. She then gazed into the moon and transformed into her  Sulong form, which increased her abilities, and she flew toward Daifuku's fleet. Overwhelming them with her speed, she took down several of Daifuku's subordinates while removing the ships' helms, and Daifuku unwittingly aided her as his genie was unable to hit her and destroyed several ships instead. However, Carrot's transformation caused her to become very exhausted, and Brook went and took her back to the Sunny, which had a clear path with Daifuku's fleet in chaos. However, Big Mom, who was rapidly growing thinner, summoned Zeus and Prometheus back to her side and boarded the Sunny to look for the wedding cake.

The Sunny crew was unable to stop her, but Big Mom ended up hitting Jinbe into the ocean, allowing him to come back and hit her with a powerful blow that knocked her off the ship. After landing on Zeus, Big Mom prepared to slice the Sunny in half, but Nami managed to distract Zeus long enough for Brook to cut the cloud homie in two. Nami then sent small thunderclouds to Zeus, forcing him to discharge again and engulfing Big Mom in lightning. The Sunny crew quickly sailed away from Big Mom as Nami captured a weakened Zeus, saying that he would become her servant.

#### A Clash of Haki: The Final Push to Freedom[]

Back on the Nostra Castello, Sanji and Bege argued over whether or not to poison the cake, and Sanji fed Bege his whipped cream to convince him not to. The cake was then completed, and the pirates and chefs celebrated. Meanwhile, Big Mom caught up to the Sunny on Prometheus, who threatened to burn the ship and crew up. However, she then smelled the cake on the approaching Nostra Castello, and headed toward it while Pudding and Sanji went to the Sunny. The Sunny crew then headed for Cacao Island, and Smoothie's fleet pursued them while Perospero followed Big Mom and the Fire Tank Pirates, who took the cake to  Liqueur Island to get it far away from the Straw Hats. Perospero feared that the Fire Tank Pirates had poisoned the cake, and was consumed with paranoia. Meanwhile, on Cacao Island, Oven had every mirror destroyed except one, had a fleet besiege the island, and gathered thousands of his crewmates to lie in wait to ambush Luffy and the Straw Hats.

After regaining his Haki, Luffy returned to the Mirro-World to confront Katakuri again. Although he was still overwhelmed by Katakuri's strength, he continued working on trying to improve his Kenbunshoku Haki by dodging the Sweet Commander's attacks. Hours passed, and Katakuri's younger sister  Charlotte Flampe entered the Mirro-World with her subordinates. Wanting to be Katakuri's favorite little sister, she and her subordinates tried to shoot Luffy, although had a difficult time doing it. As Katakuri realized what Luffy was doing and moved to finish him off quickly, Flampe managed to shoot Luffy with her blowgun, preventing him from dodging Mogura in time and causing him to receive a massive injury to his side. Katakuri assaulted Luffy with relentless attacks, but realized what had happened upon overhearing Flampe laughing. He shouted at her angrily for interfering in his fight, and stabbed himself where he hit Luffy in order to remove his advantage. In the process, Katakuri uncovered his mouth, causing Flampe to lose all respect for him and make fun of his mouth. Although Katakuri had been bullied for his mouth as a child, he paid no mind to it as he faced Luffy again, and the two of them unleashed Haoshoku Haki that knocked out Flampe's group as they faced off as equals.

Luffy had advanced his Kenbunshoku Haki enough to be able to counter Katakuri's attacks and lay hits on the Sweet Commander, and the two of them fought brutally. Luffy then attempted to end their battle by activating a form of  known as . With Snakeman, Luffy moved at an extremely fast speed, and his attacks changed direction and grew faster. Luffy and Katakuri continued exchanging blows until they eventually headed for a final clash, in which they hit each other with their strongest attacks. Both of them were knocked out for a brief period of time, and when Luffy got up, Katakuri got up as well and foresaw that Luffy would come back and take down Big Mom before falling on his back, defeated. As Luffy headed away, he was then greeted by a disguised Pekoms, who had decided to help him escape to honor Pedro's memory and so had captured Brûlée to get out of the Mirro-World.

Sanji and Pudding went on ahead to Cacao Island to rescue Luffy, and as the Sunny crew headed there, they were forced to dodge flying water slashes from Smoothie. Sanji and Pudding made it to Cacao Island, where they hid in an alley near Oven's army. Pudding bid farewell to Sanji, and kissed him before removing his memory of it. In the Mirro-World, Pekoms told Luffy he would activate his Sulong form to distract the Big Mom Pirates, even though only Pedro could bring him out of it. Pekoms and Brûlée then arrived on Cacao Island with Luffy hidden, shocking the Big Mom Pirates. Pekoms tried to activate Sulong, but was quickly overwhelmed by Oven, and the Big Mom Pirates quickly spotted the escaping Luffy. Sanji came in to rescue Luffy and as they ran off, Brûlée with tears in her eyes told everyone that Katakuri was defeated by Luffy breaking the Sweet Commander's undefeated record; hearing this the Big Mom Pirates were all shocked and outraged and went in an all-out attack. Sanji tried to escape, but he was eventually overwhelmed by the sheer force of the army and was held at gunpoint. Right then, Ichiji, Niji, and Yonji arrived to block the bullets as the Germa Kingdom fleet battled the fleet besieging Cacao Island. The three brothers took down several of the Big Mom Pirates as they brought Sanji and Luffy to safety, and Sanji and Luffy ended up flying over the Big Mom Pirates' fleet right toward the Sunny, with Reiju taking out the forces on the fleet.

Sanji and Luffy made it to the Sunny, and Germa's fleet provided backup against Smoothie and Daifuku's fleet. Judge asked Luffy why he wanted Sanji with him despite what he viewed to be Sanji's shortcomings, but Luffy saw none of those as shortcomings. Another Big Mom Pirates fleet arrived in front of the Sunny to surround the Straw Hats, but the Sun Pirates then emerged and took out the fleet to give the Straw Hats a path to freedom. Meanwhile, Oven had Brûlée bring special bullets to the Cacao Island army that would harm the Vinsmokes, and he went out to the water and boiled it to force the Sun Pirates to retreat. The Queen Mama Chanter then arrived and nearly destroyed the Sunny, but  Wadatsumi managed to replace it with the Sun Pirates' ship before carrying it in his mouth. Oven used his heat to force Wadatsumi to spit up the Sunny, but the Sun Pirates rose back up and prepared to take on the Big Mom Pirates to allow the Straw Hats to escape. Jinbe told Luffy he could not leave his old crew behind to die, and Luffy told him to reunite with his new crew on Wano once he was done. Jinbe then joined the Sun Pirates as they began battling, and as the Big Mom Pirates were occupied, the Straw Hats managed to sail out of Totto Land.

As the Fire Tank Pirates headed toward Liqueur Island with Big Mom on their tail, Chiffon said that they needed to go further ahead to  Funwari Island to give the Straw Hats enough distance from Big Mom. However, the crew struggled to withstand Prometheus' heat as he and Big Mom drew closer to them. Mont-d'Or contacted Perospero to ask about the cake, and Perospero told him about its situation. At this point, Perospero could only hope that the cake would satiate Big Mom's craving, as they would all die otherwise. Mont-d'Or then realized that Morgans and Stussy had left, and ordered them to be found to prevent them from revealing these events to the outside world.

The Fire Tank Pirates reached Funwari Island as the Nostra Castello finally gave out and sunk, and left the cake on the coast before heading out of Totto Land. Big Mom then ate the cake, and was overjoyed by its delicious flavor as her craving was satisfied. Once she regained her senses, she headed for Cacao Island to take on the Straw Hats, and her crew rejoiced as she entered the fight against the Sun Pirates and Germa.

Morgans and Stussy left Totto Land on a hot air balloon, and Morgans predicted that a member of the Worst Generation would become the next Pirate King. On Cacao Island, Pudding wept as she held the film of memories she had taken from Sanji. In the Mirro-World, Brûlée tended to Katakuri's wounds, admitting that she had seen him on his back before as she remembered how Katakuri had attacked some bullies for scarring her face as a child. Outside of Totto Land, Sanji found out about Pedro's sacrifice before going to work cooking, and as he cooked,  a rowdy pirate crew was coming to  Baratie. Despite his workers' complaints, Zeff said he would serve them food no matter what, just as his son Sanji served his crew.

### __Levely Arc__

#### Great Powers on the Move: The Upcoming Levely

Luffy,  Sanji,  Nami,  Chopper,  Brook, and  Carrot were sailing to  Wano on the  Thousand Sunny after their escape from  Totto Land when Luffy and Chopper discovered a  Raid Suit that  Niji had apparently given to Sanji. Despite the two's pleas, Sanji refused to try it, and Nami revealed the addition of  Zeus to her  Clima-Tact. Carrot then received the  newspaper, which told the story of their exploits against  Big Mom and also included two new  bounties for Sanji and Luffy. Sanji was pleased that his bounty now surpassed  Zoro's, but was dismayed that his bounty poster included  his family name. Luffy became depressed because he thought his bounty decreased to 150,000,000, when in reality it had increased to 1,500,000,000.

People all across the  world reacted strongly to the news, and on  Fish-Man Island,  Neptune was reading it as  Shirahoshi came to join  her family in traveling to the  Levely. Given  Jinbe's actions against Big Mom, Neptune planned to declare Fish-Man Island under the  Straw Hat Pirates' protection and a part of their territory. While  Sakazuki read the news at  New Marineford, he received a report that  Princess  Komane had been captured by  pirates and he was furious at the incompetence of the escort crew. Out at sea,  Rebecca told  Riku Doldo III and  Elizabello II about the news of Luffy's recent exploits when the pirate crew that had captured Komane set their eyes on the  royal escort from their submarine, planning to abduct  Viola as well. They fired a torpedo at the royals' ship, but  Koby came in and redirected the shot before jumping on board and greeting the  Dressrosa- Prodence Kingdom group.  Helmeppo and the rest of the  Marines then successfully took down the pirates and rescued Komane. Koby talked to  Kyros before Rebecca came out with the news about Luffy, and Koby grew very happy as he read it, bringing him to tears of joy.

Due to Luffy's actions against the  Big Mom Pirates and reports of  seven powerful pirate crews being under his command, he is now being called and considered as the "Fifth Emperor."  Shanks reacted positively, saying that it looked like he would be able to reunite with Luffy soon. However, the other  Emperors reacted more negatively, with  Kaidou angrily wondering why Luffy was in Big Mom's territory,  Blackbeard saying that it was too soon for Luffy to be given the title, and Big Mom herself questioning Luffy's "victory" before swearing revenge against the Straw Hats. Back on the Sunny, the Straw Hats realized that Luffy had failed to see the extra zero in his bounty, making it 1,500,000,000, to the surprise of all.

Meanwhile, the  Revolutionary Army moved their headquarters to  Momoiro Island and were preparing for a meeting of their executives while they read the news.  Ivankov praised  Dragon for the recent feats his son achieved, and was surprised to learn that Sanji was part of the  Germa Kingdom. Dragon noted that the Germa Kingdom would not be able to participate in the Levely. As they wondered why the executives were late,  Sabo receive a call from  Lindbergh, who said they got into trouble. While they waited, Dragon discussed with Sabo about their plan of declaring war against the  World Nobles in the upcoming Levely.

The mentioned trouble was revealed to be the  Peachbeard Pirates attacking the  Lulusia Kingdom. As the citizens begged for the pirates to leave, the four executives and army commanders,  Morley,  Belo Betty, Lindbergh, and  Karasu appeared. After Morley overwhelmed the pirates with her  Devil Fruit  power, Betty awakened the citizens' latent potential to fight with the  Kobu Kobu no Mi and rallied them, allowing them to overwhelm the pirates with Lindbergh and Karasu's help. After taking down the pirates, the executives told the residents to claim  Peachbeard's bounty and gave them a way to contact the revolutionaries if they needed to. As they left town, the executives talked about the Levely, which was set to occur in two days.

At New Marineford, Sakazuki heard that  Fujitora went to  Mary Geoise, which angered him. He sent  Ryokugyu to get him out, but Ryokugyu was too lazy to do it, and the two  admirals had a conversation. Fujitora said he had visited  Vegapunk while journeying, and the scientist had invented  something that could render the  Seven Warlords of the Sea system obsolete. Meanwhile, royals gathered at the  Red Port on the  Red Line, where they could enter Mary Geoise through a  Bondola. Shirahoshi was awestruck to see the surface world for the first time, while  King  Sterry was overwhelmed by a variety of people and races he had no knowledge of. As the royals went up to Mary Geoise on the Bondola, they were secretly accompanied by Morley, Karasu, and Sabo, the latter of whom was disguised as a guard next to Sterry.

#### The Meeting of the Kings: Arriving at the Holy Land

The royals riding the Bondola later reached the top of the Red Line, and they made their way to  Pangaea Castle. From his estate, Saint  Charlos spotted Shirahoshi and took an interest in her. The Levely participants all gathered inside the castle, and they conversed with each other at the socializing plaza. Several royals tried to get Shirahoshi's attention, but she accidentally offended them due to her inexperience with communication. Elsewhere, Rebecca and  Vivi got acquainted with each other while talking about Luffy. Shirahoshi overheard them and joined in on the conversation as  Sai got reacquainted with  Leo before telling his comrade that he planned to cut ties with  Kano Country.  Wapol then approached Vivi and began insulting her until  Dalton interrupted and drove him away. As Vivi got reacquainted with Dalton and  Kureha, Rebecca talked to Dalton about Luffy.

At  Impel Down  Level 6 solitary confinement,  Doflamingo asked  Magellan if he was guarding him and wondered if an assassin was coming to silence him to ensure that Mary Geoise's national treasure remained a secret. Back at Mary Geoise, a mysterious person opened a chamber where a  straw hat was stored.

Meanwhile, Big Mom contacted Kaidou to make an arrangement concerning Luffy. Kaidou opposed working with her, but she reminded him of a debt he owed her. The Marines tapped into this call and grew concerned over the possibility of the two meeting but decided against taking action because of Wano Country's defenses. At the Red Port,  Garp and several Marines heard about the call, and  Hina talked to Garp about  Rocks, an entity whose era was over 40 years ago but was currently gaining power. Back at Mary Geoise, Shanks met with the  Five Elders in person to talk about a certain pirate.

Elsewhere, Sterry was brought before the  Empty Throne to pledge never to sit on it and rule the world himself, but he became entranced by that idea. Outside, Charlos had Shirahoshi apprehended to be his pet. Leo and Sai attempted to stop the World Noble, but they were attacked by  Rob Lucci as  CP0 came to assist Charlos. Lucci stated that Charlos could do whatever he wanted as a god, and Neptune, who had already become disillusioned with living on the surface world, decided to attack Charlos and forsake  Otohime's dream. However,  Donquixote Mjosgard, the World Noble that Otohime had saved ten years ago, came in and hit Charlos with a massive, spiked club and ordered the release of Shirahoshi. Having been reformed by Otohime, Mjosgard wishes to repay his debt to the  Ryugu Kingdom.  Mansherry healed Shirahoshi's bruises, and Mjosgard promised to protect the princess from any more threats during the Levely.

Meanwhile,  Jewelry Bonney disguised herself as the queen dowager of the  Sorbet Kingdom, Connie, in order to infiltrate the Domain of the Gods where the World Nobles lived. She managed to sneak past the Celestial Dragon gate when  Rosward came to see the injured Charlos. She also saw that Rosward was riding on  Bartholomew Kuma, Warlord of the Sea and former king of the Sorbet Kingdom who had become a  slave-to-rent for the World Nobles. The infiltrating revolutionaries saw this as well as they hid underground. They reflected that Kuma's enslavement was a statement to never defy the World Nobles and decided to go ahead with a do-or-die mission to rescue Kuma.

#### Levely Begins: The World on the Verge of Cleansing

Fujitora summoned  Cobra and Doldo to meet with him, and sometime after this meeting, all the royals gathered around a table to begin the first day of the Levely conference. Meanwhile, the Five Elders stated that Cobra had requested a meeting with them, and talked about the increasing chaos in the world possibly necessitating a great cleansing. They headed for the Empty Throne, upon which sat the mysterious  Imu. Kneeling before Imu, the Five Elders requested to learn the name that Imu had deemed the "light" that must be extinguished from history.

## Wano Country Saga

### __Wano Country Arc__

#### Prologue: Getting to Wano[]

Nekomamushi and the  Guardians arrived on  Sphinx, where  Marco resided and worked as a  doctor. Marco revealed that Sphinx was  Whitebeard's homeland and his last keepsake. With  Edward Weevil and  Buckin hunting for Whitebeard's inheritance, Marco anticipated that they would attack this place, and so elected to stay behind and protect it instead of joining the  Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance against  Kaidou. However, he told Nekomamushi to give  Luffy a message from him once he arrived at  Wano Country.

Sometime later, Luffy's group read about the  Levely while sailing to Wano.  Nami noticed an article about Kaidou and  Big Mom, but was unable to read it due to  Sanji and  Chopper cutting pictures out. The crew then came to a stormy area that looked like Wano, and as they sailed through it, they encountered a school of  giant carp. They then came to the bottom of a massive waterfall, and Luffy grabbed onto two of the jumping carp to pull themselves up. At the top of the waterfall was a whirlpool, and Luffy had Sanji fly the others to land. When he tried to follow them, an octopus that had boarded the  Thousand Sunny held him back, causing him to go down into the whirlpool.

#### First Act[]

Meanwhile,  Kin'emon,  Law,  Zoro,  Usopp,  Robin, and  Franky had snuck into Wano's  Flower Capital. Kin'emon warned the group that the  shogun,  Kurozumi Orochi, had agents lurking around every corner, so they would need to disguise their identities and assimilate into the populace. Franky became an apprentice carpenter under  Minatomo, Usopp sold toad oil on the streets, and Robin trained to become a geisha performing for Orochi. Zoro, however, became a ronin, and was framed for several street murders. The magistrate sentenced him to seppuku and gleefully apprehended the stolen  Shusui, but Zoro sensed that he was the one who actually committed the murders. With the short seppuku blade, he cut down the magistrate from a considerable distance.

Luffy and the Sunny washed up on  Kuri Beach, and after coming to, Luffy immediately encountered a baboon with a sword named  Hihimaru battling a  komainu named  Komachiyo. Close by, a group of  Beasts Pirates scouts were riding to shore with a young captive girl named  Tama, whom they had captured after she mentioned the  Kozuki Family when they were harassing her at the market. They attempted to take out Luffy for illegally entering the country, but Luffy quickly brought them down. One of them was still conscious and told Hihimaru to take down Luffy, but it quickly backed down due to Luffy's  Haoshoku Haki. Tama then knocked out the scout and submitted herself to Luffy, and in his confusion she managed to  pull a piece of kibi dango from her cheek and feed it to Hihimaru, instantly taming him.

To thank Luffy, Tama helped him dock the Sunny in a hidden cave before taking him to her home to feed him. When they got to her place, she made a small meal for him out of the little rice she had. She then went out, and Luffy was suddenly confronted by her master  Tenguyama Hitetsu, who thought he had stolen her small rations. Tama then came back and revealed what happened, but she then fell ill due to drinking contaminated river water to suppress her hunger. Hitetsu said that much of the country was turned into a polluted wasteland by Kaidou and his factories, and this place,  Amigasa Village, had been destroyed by the  Shinuchi  X Drake a year ago. Tama continued living here, however, in order to wait for  Portgas D. Ace, who had come during a famine four years ago and helped feed everyone. Before he left, he had promised to take Tama along with him the next time he came. Luffy revealed that Ace had died, causing Tama to faint. He then decided to go out to the nearest town to get Tama treated by a doctor, and donned a kimono. He also chose to take the cursed sword  Nidai Kitetsu despite Hitetsu's protests, and set off with Tama.

Somewhere in  Kuri, Beasts Pirates Shinuchi  Basil Hawkins received a report that they had lost contact with their men on Kuri Beach, and Hawkins decided to deal with this himself. On the way to town, Komachiyo arrived to give Luffy and Tama a ride. They emerged from the forest into a massive wasteland, and Tama told Luffy more about the pollution in the country. Luffy then saw a woman being chased by some Beasts Pirates, only for the pirates to be cut down by someone. Luffy saw that the attacker was in fact Zoro, and quickly went to reunite with his crewmate. However, the two of them were soon confronted by Hawkins and his men. The two sides began battling, and Luffy and Zoro went after Hawkins, but he shrugged off their attacks with his  Wara Wara no Mi abilities. Komachiyo then ran in and grabbed Luffy and Zoro to make sure Tama got to treatment, and Hawkins pursued them with a giant straw avatar for a bit until Zoro managed to cut down the avatar.

As Luffy, Zoro, and Tama headed to town, they were suddenly greeted by  Tsuru, who was the woman Zoro had saved. Tsuru offered to repay them for helping her by taking them to her tea house and brewing an herb to cure Tama. At  Okobore Town, the leftovers town, the tea house's poster girl  Kiku was courted by the Flower Capital's strongest sumo wrestler  Urashima, but she declined his marriage proposal. Luffy's group then arrived, and Tsuru told Kikunojo to make the healing brew. Tama was healed after drinking it, and Tsuru gave her some porridge to eat. After very reluctantly accepting it, Tama was brought to tears by its taste. Kikunojo bandaged Zoro's wounds, and Tsuru explained that all of them in the leftover towns lived with barely any food to eat.  Kozuki Oden once had a farm to feed everyone, but that farm was now used to feed Orochi and the wealthy citizens in the nearby  Bakura Town; everything Okobore Town got were castoffs and leftovers from there. Suddenly, the group found themselves under attack from the  Gifter  Batman, who with his Bat  SMILE had overheard their conversation. While they dealt with Batman's attacks,  Gazelleman came in and kidnapped Tama to bring her to Bakura Town, which the Shinuchi  Holed'em had planned in order to find out about Hihimaru's taming.

Kikunojo immediately mounted Komachiyo to go rescue Tama, and Luffy and Zoro joined her. She explained to them the situation in Bakura Town, and revealed that she was a  samurai. On top of the mountain where  Oden Castle was located,  Bepo,  Shachi, and  Penguin spotted Luffy and Zoro from afar. When they saw the duo heading to Bakura Town, they told Law, who quickly became worried and planned to stop them. In Bakura Town, Gazelleman brought Tama to Holed'em, who decided to try testing her abilities by pulling on her cheek with pliers. Elsewhere, Urashima told the Gifter  Mouseman about Kikunojo while eating, and Mouseman encouraged him to use his high status to take her by force. Luffy, Zoro, and Kikunojo later arrived at Bakura Town, and while racing down the street, they were suddenly hit by a sumo wrestler who had been knocked out of the ring by Urashima. As Urashima was dominating his opponents, he saw Kikunojo and became ecstatic, thinking she had come to accept his proposal. He had his men bring her to him, but when he silenced and degraded the lower-class spectators, Kikunojo became mad and cut off his topknot with her sword.

One of Holed'em's men told him that Urashima's topknot had been cut off, while Hawkins and his men warned the Bakura Town forces about Luffy as they headed there themselves. Back at the sumo ring, Urashima decided to attack Kikunojo for her actions, but his attack was met by Luffy. Luffy challenged him to a sumo match for Kiku, and the two of them began fighting. Luffy was able to effortlessly dodge Urashima's attacks, and knocked him out of the ring with a single -enhanced Harite, destroying several buildings. The Beasts Pirates guards then attacked Luffy, Zoro, and Kiku, causing a fight to break out as the latter trio searched for Holed'em. Holed'em then appeared on a rooftop with Tama, angry that Luffy had sent Urashima flying into his house, and said he would kill Tama if he made a move. Law was still on the mountain when Shachi saw that a fire had broken out and Hawkins had arrived at Bakura Town, leaving him aghast.

Deep within Bakura Town, the Shinuchi and Horse SMILE user  Speed collected a cart full of clean food from the  Paradise Farm. She saw the fire and destruction around Holed'em's house as she went into town, and wondered what was going on. As Holed'em threatened Tama with  Kamijiro, the lion head growing from his stomach, Kikunojo warned Luffy that going against Holed'em would attract the wrath of the  All-Star and ruler of Kuri  Jack. However, Luffy decided to take action after seeing Speed bring the food provisions cart onto the scene, and in the blink of an eye punched Kamijiro and freed Tama. Zoro attacked the pirates around the provisions cart, and Komachiyo pulled it away. When Luffy saw that Holed'em had hurt Tama's cheek, he turned around to attack the Shinuchi. Holed'em had Kamijiro breathe fire at Luffy, but it was to no avail as Luffy took him out with .

As Hawkins entered Bakura Town, he was confronted by a masked Law, who intended to take him out before the fellow  Supernova could recognize him. However, Hawkins quickly recognized Law by his  Ope Ope no Mi power and tattoos, and after a brief clash, he removed Law's mask. He revealed to Law that he had figured out that his and Luffy's alliance had infiltrated Wano, and Law's panic only grew as Hawkins received a call that Holed'em had been taken out and Jack had been notified. Nearby, Luffy and Tama immediately started running away, and Luffy saw Speed's horse body and jumped on her. She quickly became angry, and Luffy told Tama to feed her a kibi dango, which she did. Although the dango was not supposed work on humans, it did work on Speed due to her Devil Fruit, and she happily carried Luffy and Tama away. Zoro and Kikunojo rode the provisions cart out of town, and Law hitched a ride with them in order to yell at Zoro for his actions. They took the provisions cart to Okobore Town, where they offered it to the delighted citizens. Some Gifters attempted to stop this, but they were then crushed by a massive tub of clean water that Luffy brought. As Tama ate an apple, Luffy promised her that by the time he left Wano, she would be able to eat until she is full every day, and this caused Tama to start crying as Ace had said the exact same thing.

In the Flower Capital, a teacher taught some students that Kozuki Oden and his  Nine Red Scabbards had tried to commit the evil act of opening Wano's borders, but their hero, the shogun Orochi, had defeated and killed them 20 years ago. Elsewhere in the capital, Orochi's money changer  Kyoshiro brought up the night Oden was killed, recalling how his wife  Kozuki Toki had sworn a curse on him. Orochi believed this was a prophecy that the Kozuki Family would return for vengeance in 20 years, with this year being the year of prophecy, but Kyoshiro was derisive of the shogun's paranoia, believing the Kozukis and their scabbards were all dead.

Law then told Luffy and Zoro he would take them to the ruins of Oden Castle on top of the nearby mountain. Tama bid farewell to Luffy as Speed took her back to Amigasa Village, and the villagers thanked Luffy for his actions. Kikunojo joined Law's group on the way to Oden Castle, and Luffy wondered why she wanted to go there. Zoro wandered off along the way, and when they reached the ruins, Luffy spotted graves for Kin'emon,  Kanjuro,  Raizo, and  Momonosuke, and was led to believe they were dead. However, Kin'emon then appeared, queasy but very alive, and Luffy also reunited with Momonosuke and his crew from  Whole Cake Island while Kikunojo excitedly greeted Kin'emon. Law and Kin'emon then took the  Straw Hats inside to eat, and there, Kin'emon revealed that his group had come here by traveling 20 years forward in time. Meanwhile, a lost Zoro decided to head toward a wharf, where he took a ride on a boat.

Kin'emon talked about Oden's history, explaining that he was the son of shogun Kozuki Sukiyaki, but had been exiled from the Flower Capital for participating in violent fights. While in exile, he went to Kuri, which was then the most lawless region in Wano, and defeated its most dangerous criminal  Ashura Doji. After rounding up the other criminals, Oden was granted the title of  daimyo of Kuri by his father. He gathered many of his followers during that time, including  Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, after they had drifted ashore. However, he felt confined by Wano's borders and so illegally set off to sea, first sailing with the  Whitebeard Pirates before joining the Pirate King  Gol D. Roger and the  Roger Pirates.

However, this ultimately led to his execution 20 years ago. After Oden's execution, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, Kiku, and another retainer managed to escape and head for Oden's wife and two children, Momonosuke and  Hiyori, in Oden Castle, but Kaidou had set it ablaze. After getting into the burning castle and finding Oden's family, Toki decided to send Momonosuke, Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, and Kikunojo forward in time with her  Toki Toki no Mi ability while she would die here, and Kin'emon promised to fulfill Oden's wishes. They were then sent 20 years into the future, where they saw gravestones with their names on it. They traveled through the new Wano and initially despaired, but they were able to find people who were still loyal to the Kozuki Family, and set off to sea to find more allies to fight Shogun Orochi and Kaidou, which led to them finding the Straw Hats and Law.

With the alliance now formed, Kin'emon revealed that their goal was not to wage a full-scale war, but to conduct a raid on Kaidou's home of  Onigashima during the  Fire Festival two weeks from now. He presented a secret message to tell recipients to meet at the  Habu Port at the appointed time, which they would pass out to their allies, who were marked by a crescent moon symbol on their ankles. Zoro's group was already working to gain intel in the Flower Capital, and the rest of the Straw Hats would do the same. Kin'emon had Nami train to be a  kunoichi, and summoned the master kunoichi  Shinobu to train her. Finally, he told the alliance that there were three samurai they particularly needed to find, as they were each worth 100 men: Ashura Doji,  Kawamatsu, and  Denjiro.

Back in Okobore Town, the citizens found themselves under attack by  Shutenmaru and the  Mt. Atama Thieves. The thieves took their food, and Shutenmaru felt no pity for the citizens, believing that there were no heroes who would really feed and protect them. Jack then rode into town looking for Luffy and confronted Shutenmaru, saying that his crew would only let the thief live if he joined Kaidou. Shutenmaru refused and attacked Jack, and the two sparred. However, their fight was soon interrupted when Kaidou suddenly came flying in as a dragon, wanting to know where Luffy and Law were. Kin'emon's group was shocked to see Kaidou, and Law revealed why he had come, saying that he and Luffy needed to deal with this alone to keep the rest of them from being exposed. Kaidou drunkenly flew around Okobore Town, dealing lots of destruction in the process, and to stop the destruction, Hawkins raced in and unintentionally yet accurately claimed that Luffy and Law were at the ruins of Oden Castle. Kaidou immediately flew toward the ruins and instantly blew them apart with fire breath, and this caused Luffy to become extremely angry and attack him.

After the attack, Luffy raced back toward the ruins when he encountered a heavily injured Speed, who revealed that Kaidou had attacked her and Tama on the way to Amigasa Village. With no idea if any of his allies were safe, Luffy decided to try ending the plan immediately and confronted Kaidou. He spared no time in pummeling the  Emperor with his most powerful attacks, bringing him back into his human form. After Luffy's onslaught, however, Kaidou got back up without any signs of damage and knocked him out with one swing of his mace.

Law attempted to bring Luffy to him, but was hit with a  Seastone nail and attacked by Hawkins, forcing him to flee. Luffy knocked out several pirates with Haoshoku Haki when they tried to apprehend them, and Kaidou decided to have him thrown in prison to break his spirit and make him a subordinate. Now that he was sober, Kaidou decided to go after Law later and flew off to Onigashima to drink. Meanwhile, Kin'emon had gone to Okobore Town to check on his wife Tsuru, and was happy to find her alive and well, but did not intend on reuniting with her until after their mission had been accomplished. He then spotted Shutenmaru riding away, and recognized him as Ashura Doji. In the now-destroyed castle ruins, the alliance was able to survive the blast due to Shinobu rotting the ground away with her  Juku Juku no Mi abilities, and after getting out of the hole, Kikunojo prepared to tell them about the current situation in Wano. In the wastelands of Kuri, Inuarashi and his  Musketeers found the injured Tama and took her to receive treatment.

An extra edition of the newspaper covering the fight was printed out, and Usopp, Franky, Robin, and Zoro were appalled when they read it. The next day, Luffy was taken to the  Prisoner Mines in  Udon, where prisoners tirelessly worked to build weapons for Kaidou. One mysterious prisoner was fed a poisoned fish that was supposed to be boneless, and when Luffy was brought inside the prison, a guard attempted to attack him for glaring at him. However, the mysterious prisoner spit the fish bones at the guard, taking him out. The guards threw Luffy into a cell, saying that starting tomorrow they would break his spirit by working him to death. Luffy's cell was next to  Eustass Kid's, and they both swore revenge against Kaidou, causing them to realize each other's presence. Kid decided that he could do everything better than Luffy causing an outrage of a competition between these two captains.

#### Interlude: Gecko Moria vs. Blackbeard[]

On  Kuraigana Island,  Perona was elated to see news of  Gecko Moria being alive. She decided to go find him, which  Mihawk stated might be for the best because of some developments at the Levely. Meanwhile, Moria invaded  Hachinosu with his  zombie army to confront  Blackbeard and find the missing  Absalom, who had come to the island a few days ago. However, Moria found out that Absalom had been killed after  Catarina Devon impersonated him with the  Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Kyubi no Kitsune, allowing  Shiryu to use the  Suke Suke no Mi power he had stolen from Absalom to attack Moria and his army. Blackbeard then called out to Moria from his hideout, inviting the former  Warlord of the Sea to join his crew and revealing recent earth-shaking events including the executives of the  Revolutionary Army fighting  Admirals  Fujitora and  Ryokugyu during the Levely and the Straw Hats' arrival at Wano Country.

#### Second Act[]

On Mt. Atama, Inuarashi clashed with Ashura Doji as Kin'emon, Momonosuke, Kiku, the  minks, and Ashura's men looked on. Kin'emon stopped the fight, and Ashura refused to rejoin the Kozuki Family, saying he was only loyal to Oden and the rest of his followers' absences the past 20 years left a hole too large to be filled. In Amigasa Village, Tama recovered from her injuries, and on Onigashima, Jack was berated by his fellow All-Stars  King and  Queen for the low offerings from Kuri.

In the Flower Capital, among news about the thief  Ushimitsu Kozo and street murderer  Kamazo, the Kozuki Family's allies received Kin'emon's secret message and understood it. As this happened, Nami and Shinobu infiltrated a high-ranking official's house to spy on a covert weapons trade deal, though were caught and forced to flee. While gliding away, Nami saw that Sanji had opened a soba stand on the street. Usopp, Robin, and Franky reunited with Sanji as they ate his soba, but trouble quickly arose when three thugs from the  Kyoshiro Family came to try extorting money from him. When Sanji refused, they hit a little girl's bowl out of her hands, resulting in Sanji and Franky beating two of them to the ground. The third one ran off to report this to Kyoshiro, who told him to contact Queen to send assassins after Sanji.

In the aftermath, Sanji gave the little girl another bowl of soba, and she introduced herself as  Toko, laughing whenever she spoke. After eating, Toko raced off to join the oiran  Komurasaki, whom she worked for as a kamuro. Robin's master came in and revealed that Komurasaki was the greatest of all oiran in Wano, and that Robin would be accompanying her to Orochi's banquet. As Komurasaki paraded through the street, she left many men incapacitated in her wake, she was attacked by a group of men whom she had swindled after tricking them into giving her money to purchase her freedom. The men were quickly taken out by a guard and exiled, and Komurasaki coldly looked down on them. In Amigasa Village, Tama asked Momonosuke about his sister Hiyori, and he replied that he believed that she was still alive and now 26 years old. However, he did not intend to reunite with her until after the war to prevent Orochi from targeting her.

In  Orochi Castle, Orochi met with agents from  CP0, who were trying to broker a new deal for Kaidou's weapons after  Doflamingo's downfall. Orochi decided to use the immense amount of leverage he had to demand that they bring him  Vegapunk to continue their trade. When  Joseph protested, Orochi shot him, saying he was untouchable due to Kaidou backing him. Orochi then went to partake in his banquet, where he celebrated with Komurasaki, Robin, and many others. As the banquet progressed, Robin snuck off to try to gather information. However, she was caught by Orochi's ninja squad, the  Orochi Oniwabanshu. The ninja moved to restrain her, only to find out it was a body double. As Robin ran back to the banquet hall, their leader  Fukurokuju ordered them to sneak around and find her. Robin reported her situation to Nami, Shinobu, and Brook, who had also infiltrated the castle.

After Robin returned to the banquet hall, Orochi overheard Kyoshiro talking about avenging his comrades and used the opportunity to warn everyone about Toki's prophecy and the impending return of the Kozuki Family. The guests all believed Orochi's paranoia to be lunacy, but kept quiet. However, Toko was unable to prevent herself from bursting into laughter, resulting in Orochi becoming enraged. He attempted to attack Toko with a sword, resulting in Komurasaki slapping him. Despite the grave consequences of such an action, she stood her ground and refused to apologize.

Orochi transformed into the  Yamata no Orochi and tried to avoid attacking her, but his anger eventually overcame his attraction, and he wrested her into his mouth. Meanwhile, the Orochi Oniwabanshu spotted Robin running away with Toko and chased her, although she managed to overpower them with Brook's help. One of the Oniwabanshu,  Hanzo, crawled into the attic and discovered Nami and Shinobu hiding out there. Shinobu incapacitated him before destroying the floor, sending it crashing down onto Orochi below and freeing Komurasaki from his grasp. The oiran then stood in front of Kyoshiro and let him strike her down in order to give her a samurai's mercy. Orochi was distraught to see Komurasaki be killed, and he started chasing after Robin and Toko. However, Nami summoned  Zeus and brought him down onto the shogun, striking him with a massive thunderbolt.

As Franky was working, Minatomo revealed to him that he had pawned off the blueprints to Kaidou's mansion, leaving Franky enraged. He ran off to the pawn shop, and worked to trace the passage of the blueprints from person to person. The trail went cold after a man named  Rakuda revealed that a man from Kuri had stolen them from him, and Franky reported this to Kin'emon. Kin'emon took overlooking for the blueprints as the minks brought in food and weapons, they stole from the Beasts Pirates; they had forged a note to make the pirates think that the Mt. Atama Thieves had stolen it.

Meanwhile, X Drake and  Page One, two of the strongest six Shinuchi known as the Tobiroppo, went through the Flower Capital to look for Sanji. Law snuck up to Sanji and told him to go hide, and they along with Usopp and Sanji ran off. However, Page One started rampaging in his  spinosaurus form and attacked citizens to draw Sanji out. This worked as Sanji attacked Page One, and as Page One called X Drake for backup, Sanji assured his comrades that he would finish this quickly without being spotted as he pulled out his  Raid Suit. Sanji donned the Raid Suit, and Law recognized him as the character  Stealth Black from . Sanji became invisible and attacked Page One by surprise, sending him crashing into a building. Page One transformed into his hybrid form and hit Sanji through multiple buildings with his immense strength. However, Sanji was barely hurt and attacked Page One from above, and Law, Usopp, and Franky fled the Flower Capital and headed toward  Ebisu Town.

Meanwhile, Zoro walked through the region of  Kibi with a taikomochi named  Tonoyasu. Tonoyasu was enamored with him and stuck along after Zoro had saved him from some  yakuza thugs. The two of them headed toward Ebisu Town, which was where Tonoyasu originated. At Ebisu Town, Zoro met its citizens, who all laughed constantly and refused to let their extreme poverty and hunger bring them down.

Robin, Nami, Brook, and Shinobu escaped from Orochi Castle, and after dropping Toko off in the  Red-Light District went with Kanjuro to the  Northern Cemetery in  Ringo. There, they talked about Kyoshiro's actions, and Kanjuro wondered what to make of him, as in his time Wano's top yakuza boss was a man named  Hyogoro of the Flower. Brook revealed that there was a  Poneglyph in the basement of Orochi Castle, but it was not the Road Poneglyph, which was likely on Onigashima. Nami, Robin, and Shinobu then headed back to the Flower Capital to go to a  bathhouse.

In the Prisoner Mine in Udon, while an elderly prisoner named Grandpa Hyo collapsed under the back-breaking work, Luffy and Kid moved large blocks at a rapid rate and were rewarded with large amounts of kibi dango to eat. This caused the vice warden  Dobon to go on a rampage due to his food reserves running out, and he stepped on Hyo as he attempted to kill Luffy and Kid in his hippopotamus mouth. Luffy and Kid quickly took him out, and although attacking a warden would result in execution, they avoided punishment due to no one seeing them inside Dobon's hippo, and they became heroes among the prisoners as Luffy carried Hyo off. The next day, Hyo thanked Luffy for saving him, and Luffy gave him some meal tickets to keep his energy up. Raizo, having infiltrated the prison, came up to Luffy to tell him that he located the keys to his Seastone handcuffs, but they were in a heavily guarded room.  Caribou then went to Luffy to ask for meal tickets, offering to become his subordinate if given some, but Luffy refused.

On Onigashima, Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates were on high alert as the  Big Mom Pirates were approaching Wano Country on the  Queen Mama Chanter. They had attached the Chanter to the giant carp to pull them up the waterfall. However, King then flew in with the power of the  Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Pteranodon and crashed into the ship, sending it falling back down the waterfall, with Big Mom falling into the ocean in the process. The rest of the Big Mom Pirates landed safely on the Chanter, and they wondered what would become of Big Mom. Some of them were worried that Kaidou would kill her, as the two Emperors hated each other after once being crewmates.

That morning, Chopper, Momonosuke, Tama, and Kiku walked down to Kuri Beach when they saw Big Mom washed ashore. Chopper became frantic while the other three wondered who she was. However, Big Mom revealed herself to have no memory of who she was. A day later, Chopper's group brought Big Mom to Okobore Town, where Tsuru served her some  oshiruko. Big Mom took a liking to the oshiruko, and Chopper told her that there was lots of it in Udon to get her to go there. Big Mom tamed a  wanizame by hitting it, and the group rode it on their long journey to save Luffy. Momonosuke resumed practicing his sportsmanship, and shouted "sunacchi" after having heard Zoro tell him about it being used in his  homeland. Kiku told him not to say it, as it was a cry used by past generations in Kuri that was unbefitting of someone of his status.

In the Prisoner Mine, the guards were set on high alert as Kid had managed to escape, and Raizo had successfully stolen the handcuff keys. As Luffy was prodded for information, Hyo was attacked by the warden  Babanuki and vice warden  Daifugo, as they did not believe he earned all his meal tickets. Hyo accepted his death, as he was now happy after witnessing Luffy's act of kindness, which he had not seen in the country since before Kaidou's takeover when he was Hyogoro of the Flower. However, Luffy then rushed in and kicked Daifugo, which was seen by everyone around him. Right as Luffy made his attack, Queen arrived at the Prisoner Mine. Luffy managed to injure Daifugo despite being weakened by his handcuffs, but was quickly overwhelmed by Babanuki after the warden shot an explosive blast from his elephant SMILE's trunk. Queen then made his entrance, and Babanuki told him what was going on. Luffy and Hyogoro were brought before Queen, who decided to make their execution entertaining. Meanwhile, as Raizo drew closer to Luffy, he heard the mysterious prisoner calling out to him, and was shocked to realize that this prisoner was his comrade Kawamatsu.

Raizo had to leave Kawamatsu after being spotted, and Queen put Luffy and Hyogoro into a sumo ring. He had  special collars affixed to their necks, saying that if they were forced out of the ring, the collars would go off and decapitate them. To decrease their disadvantage, he had Luffy's handcuffs removed, much to Raizo's bewilderment. A group of  Waiters then charged into the ring, but Luffy quickly knocked all of them out with his Haoshoku Haki. He then easily beat the  Pleasures, and tried to hit them by projecting  Haki from his palm like he had seen  Rayleigh do, but was unsuccessful. The Gifters  Alpacaman and  Madilloman entered the ring, and Luffy used his advanced  Kenbunshoku Haki to help Hyo avoid their attacks, but continued to fail at advancing his  Busoshoku Haki. Hyogoro eventually recognized what he was trying to do, revealing that people from Wano know it as . He then ran up toward Alpacaman and hit him with a burst of projected Haki, and offered to train Luffy in its usage.

Sanji, Usopp, Franky, and Law reached Ebisu Town, where they heard the news about Komurasaki's death and met Tonoyasu. Yasu revealed that Zoro had left to chase after a thief who took his sword, and during their interaction, the group realized that Sanji had left as well. Meanwhile, Nami, Robin, and Shinobu made it to the bathhouse, and as they bathed, Shinobu told them about Hyogoro, whom she knew would corral enough respect to substantially increase their numbers. However, she believed him to be dead. Suddenly, Hawkins and Drake commenced a raid on the bathhouse, and rounded up everyone with a crescent moon on their ankle, which they knew to be a symbol of loyalty to the Kozuki Family. Nami tried hiding behind Shinobu, and Hawkins spotted her and tried to draw her out, unwittingly disrobing her. This caused Sanji to inadvertently deactivate his Raid Suit power and reveal his presence, and Hawkins and Drake recognized him as he quickly flew his three comrades out of the bathhouse. As they fled, Sanji revealed that in addition to Orochi knowing about the ankle tattoo, he had also captured Law's crewmates to lure him out.

Meanwhile, Zoro chased the sword thief, a warrior monk named  Gyukimaru, to  Oihagi Bridge in Ringo. Gyukimaru had already returned Shusui to  Ryuma's grave, and Zoro clashed blades with him to try and get it back. After fighting for a bit, they were suddenly interrupted as Komurasaki and Toko raced onto the scene, pursued by Kamazo the Manslayer. Zoro intercepted Kamazo, who unbeknownst to the public was an assassin in Orochi's service, and was sent by the shogun to kill Toko. Komurasaki begged Zoro to help them, and he agreed in exchange for food and alcohol. Zoro and Kamazo then commenced an intense duel, and were even until Gyukimaru decided to attack Zoro again. With Zoro turning his focus to the monk, Kamazo was able to pierce him through the shoulder with one of his scythes. However, Kamazo was unable to pull it out, allowing Zoro to take it and put it into his mouth. Zoro then attacked Kamazo with , striking him down. Immediately afterwards, Gyukimaru departed as Zoro lost consciousness from his wound.

Zoro woke up in a house in the Northern Cemetery, where he found himself being tended to by Komurasaki. She thanked him and told him about her and Toko's situation, and revealed that she was actually Momonosuke's younger sister Hiyori. Hiyori told Zoro about how she stayed behind in the past to ensure the Kozuki Family bloodline kept going, and was taken care of by Kawamatsu. Zoro wondered about the alliance's next course of action now that Orochi had gained an advantage on them, but went to sleep to help himself heal.

Meanwhile, Kin'emon's group found out that Orochi had discovered the meaning of their secret messages, and in the Flower Capital, hundreds of Kozuki Family supporters were rounded up and put into a large prison in  Rasetsu Town. After Sanji's group came to Ebisu, Shinobu blamed Law's crewmates for revealing the secret, causing Law to get into an argument with her, and Law then left in anger to save his crewmates himself. Tonoyasu came up with the secret message, and asked that Shinobu's group tell Kin'emon that he would be participating in the final battle. Though he spoke to them like a familiar, Kanjuro and Shinobu were unsure of who he was. Yasu then went around helping various townspeople, and an old woman said that although his daughter, Toko, sent him money from the Flower Capital, he gave most of it away and was considered a saint by the townspeople.

In the Prisoner Mine, Luffy continued hitting opponents out of the sumo ring, but was still unable to progress his Haki. Night fell and the Beasts Pirates all retired, leaving Luffy and Hyogoro in the ring. After Luffy knocked out the guards around them with Haoshoku Haki, he and Hyogoro were approached by Raizo and Caribou, whose handcuffs were the ones Raizo got the key for. Raizo was happy to see Hyogoro and told Luffy who he really was, and Hyogoro said they possessed a great opportunity in this prison, as many people were sent here for rebellion against Orochi. Winning these people to their side, including the regional yakuza bosses and Kawamatsu, would substantially increase their allies. Raizo and Caribou then acquired Queen's oshiruko stash and gave it to Luffy and Hyogoro, who ate all of it. When morning came, Queen noticed that they had grown fat, though did not suspect they had eaten his oshiruko and his subordinates were too afraid to tell him.

In the Flower Capital, Fukurokuju reported to Orochi that Ushimitsu Kozo had been caught, and Orochi was surprised to find out his identity. The shogun ordered that the thief be publicly crucified, and had it broadcast along with Komurasaki's funeral. Meanwhile, Brook found Zoro, Hiyori, and Toko in the Northern Cemetery, and he told them about the development with Ushimitsu Kozo, revealing that he was Tonoyasu. Toko immediately ran off to save her father, forcing Zoro and Hiyori to chase after her. As they watched the broadcast of Yasu's crucifixion, Kanjuro and Shinobu finally recognized him as  Shimotsuki Yasuie, the former daimyo of  Hakumai. Many years ago, Oden had hung around Hakumai after being exiled by Sukiyaki, and was cavalier about becoming shogun as he believed Yasuie to be better suited for succeeding his father. However, Yasuie had none of that, as he was intent on Oden living up to his father's challenge. Sometime later, Yasuie had caught the Nine Red Scabbards stealing money to give to Oden. To their surprise, he let them take the money, with the command to serve Oden well on his way to becoming the next shogun.

Meanwhile, one of Holed'em's men set fire to Mt. Atama to get revenge on the thefts that were committed by Kin'emon's group under the guise of the Mt. Atama Thieves, and Ashura Doji led his men to attack Bakura Town. With them heading out, Kin'emon and Inuarashi raced toward Bakura Town to intercept them. As they reached Bakura Town, they watched the broadcast of Yasuie's execution. Yasuie revealed to the crowd that he was actually not Ushimitsu Kozo, and only claimed to be him to get a public execution. He then claimed that he created the Kozuki Family's secret message as a joke, and that the crescent moon tattoo was just a popular symbol from the past. This caused Orochi's subordinates to start having doubts, and as Orochi was being brought to the execution platform, he became enraged after hearing Yasuie curse him. Orochi and his men then shot Yasuie multiple times, and Yasuie accepted his death as he had managed to change the alliance's meeting place for the final battle and tell all the Rasetsu Town prisoners about it.

As Yasuie fell down to the ground dead, the Ebisu Town citizens who had made their way to the capital started laughing profusely, and Zoro was appalled at this. However, Hiyori revealed to him that they were forced to laugh due to consuming SMILEs. She explained that only one out of ten SMILEs grant animal transformation powers, and the rest forced their consumers to only express positive emotions. The Pleasures were the Beasts Pirates who ate these defective SMILEs. However, Orochi had decided to decrease the amount of suffering he saw in the country by mixing the leftover defective SMILEs in with the food that the leftovers town citizens ate, resulting in them receiving the side effects and only being able to laugh. Several of the Straw Hats and Kin'emon also learned this as they watched the broadcast, and in the Flower Capital, Orochi reveled in the laughter. He then saw Toko at the execution platform trying to revive her father with toad oil, and prepared to shoot her. However, Zoro and Sanji both came in at the same time to protect Toko.

Zoro unleashed a flying slash attack on Orochi, and the shogun froze in fear, but the attack was intercepted by Kyoshiro. As Zoro clashed with Kyoshiro, Sanji found himself under attack from X Drake. Usopp, Franky, Nami, and Robin then came into attack Orochi's men, and chaos erupted in the city as Orochi was carried away to safety. A short time later, the Orochi Oniwabanshu joined the fight, seeking to capture just one of the Straw Hats. Meanwhile, Law snuck up to the Rasetsu prison but was caught by Hawkins. Hawkins revealed that he had tied his life force to Law's captured crewmates, so Law would have to kill them to get to him.

After Luffy, Hyogoro, and the Prisoner Mine guards watched the execution broadcast, Babanuki reported to Queen that two criminals had just been brought in. Kid and Kamazo were then brought in, and Kid was distraught to see Kamazo's state, revealing that he was Killer and was now forced to laugh all the time after eating a defective SMILE. Queen then had Kid and Killer submerged into a tub and resumed the  Sumo Inferno, telling Luffy that they would stay in there until he and Hyogoro died. Luffy tried to attack Queen, but to no avail. However, Big Mom then broke into the mine, looking for oshiruko. Queen was immediately angered about her wanting to take his favorite food, and transformed into a  brachiosaurus to confront her. However, Big Mom slammed his head into the ground before swinging him around by the neck and throwing him into the wall with monstrous force, leaving him defeated. As Queen flew into the wall, he knocked over the contraption holding Kid and Killer, freeing them, and also broke Kawamatsu's cell door.

The Beasts Pirates tried to contact Kaidou, but could not get a signal, as Caribou had gotten the idea to smother the  Boss Tanishi that facilitated communication outside of Udon. Big Mom found Queen's oshiruko container, only to become depressed as she found it empty. Luffy then unwittingly revealed that he and Hyogoro had eaten all of it, causing Big Mom to attack them in a fit of rage as she had wanted to take the oshiruko back to Okobore Town and share it with the people there. Big Mom's attacks pushed Luffy and Hyo toward the edge of the sumo ring, and they were eventually forced out. However, right before their collars went off, Luffy managed to rip them off.

Luffy recognized that he had done what Rayleigh had done to  Camie on the  Sabaody Archipelago, and Hyogoro stated that he had gone beyond projecting his Haki and went a step further to using Haki to destroy objects from the inside. Hyo decided to have Luffy continue training with his life on the line by ordering him to protect him from Big Mom. Luffy tried projecting his Haki to block Big Mom's attack, but was unsuccessful and Big Mom hit him into the wall before chasing him around the entire Prisoner Mine. While Big Mom was chasing Luffy, Queen came up with a plan to try to stop her. When they returned to the clearing, Queen dove on Big Mom in his brachiosaurus form and hit her on the head with immense force. Rather than harming her, though, it restored her memories, and she recognized Queen. However, she then fell asleep, and Queen immediately took action to have her restrained with Seastone and he took her to Onigashima, leaving Babanuki in charge of restoring order. With the chaos dying, Luffy decided to take over the prison.

Babanuki ordered the prisoners to subdue Luffy, and to Luffy's surprise they did so, as they told him that they had no wish to suffer further by rebelling against Kaidou. Daifugo started shooting the prisoners with  Excite Bullets made by Queen that transmitted a contagious virus known as  Mummy, and some of the guards went into Kawamatsu's cell to kill him. However, Raizo came in and threw the key to Kawamatsu's handcuffs as well as his sword  Soto Muso into his cell, allowing Kawamatsu to free himself and repel his enemies. He, Raizo, Kikunojo, and Chopper then joined Luffy and Hyogoro in standing against the Beasts Pirates, while Momonosuke and Tama, who were ordered to stay outside, snuck inside the mine unseen. They were able to easily overpower their enemies, but were threatened by the prisoners, who could transmit Mummy to them with just a touch. However, Luffy then grabbed all the prisoners, pointing out that they were still suffering even when helping Kaidou's crew, and said that joining his alliance's revolt would be their only shot at changing that. This won over the prisoners, and Babanuki attempted to shoot them with a powerful Excite Shell, but Luffy foresaw this and tied up his elephant trunk, resulting in Babanuki being engulfed in the explosion. The prisoners then attacked Daifugo, and Udon was successfully liberated.

In the aftermath, Kid and Killer departed from the Prisoner Mine, with Kid being finished with  pirate alliances and going to look for the rest of his crew. As Chopper treated Luffy's virus, Hyogoro, Raizo, Kiku, and Kawamatsu talked to the prisoners, who despite seeing them were still skeptical that they had come from 20 years in the past. Momonosuke was then called out while he was talking to Luffy, and when the prisoners saw him, they all bowed and expressed their relief, gaining confidence at seeing a member of the Kozuki Family still alive. Kawamatsu then headed off on his own to attend to some business, promising to reunite with everyone before the final battle. Within a day, Chopper had cured all the prisoners of the Mummy virus, and Hyogoro reunited with the four regional yakuza bosses:  Omasa,  Tsunagoro,  Cho, and  Yatappe, who nearly killed Luffy after he referred to Hyogoro casually. The yakuza bosses then declared they would go around the country and recruit the remaining rebels scattered around.

On Onigashima, the Beasts Pirates worked nonstop to feed Big Mom as the All-Stars squabbled among themselves about what to do with her. Big Mom asked King to join her crew, as his race was one of the three not present in  Totto Land, but he refused. Kaidou then came and ordered for Big Mom's chains to be removed, and after his subordinates reluctantly obliged, he and Big Mom brought out their weapons and engaged in a clash so powerful it split the heavens. The two of them fought nonstop all night, and the Beasts Pirates were terrified at what might happen to Onigashima. Queen pondered escaping to return to Udon, but received a call from Babanuki. Babanuki reported that all had been settled in the Prisoner Mine, as he had been tamed with Tama's kibi dango and was now her servant.

At Bakura Town, Ashura Doji attacked Kin'emon for setting him up. Kin'emon gave a sincere apology, though pointed out that there was still hope to avenge Oden due to Yasuie's final actions. Ashura then took him and Inuarashi to show them something. He brought them to a massive graveyard in Kuri, and explained that ten years ago, these samurai had all grown tired of waiting for the Kozuki Family to return and, despite his wishes, had set out to Onigashima to fight, where they all lost their lives. Deciding not to doubt the Kozuki Family's reasoning for waiting 20 years, Ashura and his thieves brigade joined Kin'emon's alliance. Ashura then took Kin'emon and Inuarashi to Port Itachi, where he showed them many old ships that could be used to sail to Onigashima. Kin'emon was ecstatic to see this, planning for Franky to get the ships in working condition. Kin'emon was further overjoyed to find that Ashura also had the blueprints to Kaidou's mansion in his possession, and soon afterward received a call from Raizo about the fighters they had recruited in the Prisoner Mine. However, Raizo did note that they lacked weapons to arm all their allies with.

In the Flower Capital, Orochi was enraged to hear that the Straw Hats had escaped, though Fukurokuju assured him that the Oniwabanshu and the shogun's samurai squad the  Mimawarigumi were patrolling the city. Sanji and Shinobu watched the Rasetsu Town prison, whose occupants had not been freed even as the guards continued to doubt Orochi thanks to Yasuie. Meanwhile, Law had been brought into the prison after offering himself in exchange for his crewmates, threatening to sacrifice them to kill Hawkins otherwise. Bepo, Shachi, and Penguin found Nami in Ebisu Town, and gave her a copy of the secret message that had been altered by Yasuie. Nami noticed that he had drawn lines through the snake drawing, and said she would show it to Kin'emon as she departed for Amigasa Village with Franky and Kanjuro, who had Yasuie's body in his possession.

Meanwhile, at the  Enma Shrine in the forest, Zoro managed to cut down all the Oniwabanshu ninja who pursued him and Hiyori. He and Hiyori then decided to head back to Ringo, with Zoro wanting to reclaim Shusui from Gyukimaru and wishing to kill Orochi with his own hands. The next day, Zoro returned to Oihagi Bridge and clashed with Gyukimaru again, but their fight was interrupted by the arrival of Kawamatsu. Hiyori tearfully reunited with Kawamatsu, but they were interrupted again as some Beasts Pirates shot Gyukimaru to try to get their weapons back. Zoro and Kawamatsu quickly started attacking the pirates, and Gyukimaru ran away as he expressed joy seeing Kawamatsu again.

Zoro chased after him, and Kawamatsu and Hiyori talked. Hiyori told Kawamatsu that she had left him so he would stop giving all his food to her, and Kawamatsu revealed that after she left him 13 years ago, he had gone to Ringo to collect the weapons left on the graves there. While there, he had met the  komagitsune  Onimaru, who was the companion of the late daimyo of Ringo  Shimotsuki Ushimaru. Onimaru initially opposed his effort to collect the weapons, but eventually relented due to Kawamatsu's willingness to sacrifice himself for it. Onimaru became Kawamatsu's companion and helped him stockpile the weapons, and Kawamatsu donned the alias of "Gyukimaru" to chase away grave robbers. Kawamatsu was later caught in the Flower Capital and imprisoned in Udon, and in the present, he did not expect to see Onimaru still here. He and Hiyori caught up to Zoro, who revealed that Gyukimaru had opened up a secret chamber before heading off. The trio went into the chamber, where they found all the weapons from the graves ornately collected. Kawamatsu contacted Kin'emon to tell him that they now had weapons to arm their allies with for the final battle, and outside the chamber, Gyukimaru transformed into Onimaru.

Hiyori told Zoro that he should leave Shusui with Ryuma's grave and offered to replace it with  Enma, a  Meito that Oden had passed down to her which was the only weapon to have wounded Kaidou. Zoro reluctantly agreed, though Kawamatsu had many reservations. In the Rasetsu Town prison, Law had overwhelmed Hawkins and cut him up, and told him to reveal what happened to his alliance with Kid and  Scratchmen Apoo. Hawkins stated that Apoo had been working for Kaidou since the beginning, and Kaidou wanted to recruit him, Kid, and Killer to join his crew. He had obliged due to having no chance of survival otherwise, but Kid and Killer had fought until they collapsed. Hawkins wondered if Law had any doubts about his alliance with Luffy now that they were in Wano, but Law gave no answer as he headed out of his cell. Law told a mysterious person nearby that if their plan involved facilitating his escape, he would go along with it.

As Luffy trained in the Prisoner Mine to improve his Haki and Franky, Usopp, and the minks worked to repair the ships, the rest of the Straw Hats and Nine Red Scabbards met to discuss the strategy for the final battle. Nami brought up Yasuie's message alteration to Kin'emon, and he deduced that the lines on the snake represented legs, meaning the snake was now a lizard and thus their new meeting spot was to be  Tokage Port in Udon. Zoro and Kawamatsu then revealed that Hiyori was alive, which overjoyed Momonosuke and the Scabbards. Hitetsu then arrived to present Enma and the sword Oden gave to Momonosuke,  Ame no Habakiri. Momonosuke declined to take Ame no Habakiri at the moment, and Zoro took Enma, but quickly found that it instantly drained much of his Haki. Zoro managed to get his Haki back, successfully bringing Enma under his control. In the next four days, the yakuza bosses recruited 200 more people, bringing the alliance's total numbers to 4,200, which was still well short of Kaidou and Orochi's forces which were projected to number around 30,000; the alliance was also unable to find a way to free the Rasetsu Town prisoners. By the culmination of those remaining days, Luffy had managed to successfully project his Haki, and Zoro continued improving his skill with Enma. Hitetsu revealed to him that Enma and  Wado Ichimonji were made by the same person, a man named  Shimotsuki Kozaburo who had illegally left Wano over five decades ago.

On the day before the final battle, Momonosuke and Shinobu joined the Nine Red Scabbards, save for Nekomamushi and the still-missing Denjiro, on a trek to Tokage Port to get ready for the raid, and Kin'emon bid farewell to Luffy after the latter arrived at Amigasa Village. Kin'emon's group then set off through the wasteland as many workers across the country spread rumors about their potential resurgence. However, at Hakumai, Apoo arrived at Wano via a gondola accessible through a cave under the waterfall surrounding the country. Accompanying him were the  Numbers, a group of large, monstrous people from Onigashima, and Apoo looked forward to the upcoming Fire Festival. On Onigashima, King reported to Queen that the Numbers were coming back, and Kaidou and Big Mom were partying happily. They then announced that they had formed a pirate alliance, and would resume trying to kill each other after taking over the world; this announcement was met with great shock. Meanwhile, on the cusp of the Fire Festival, Orochi received a report that revealed that the alliance's new meeting place was Port Tokage, and that Hiyori was alive and hiding in Ringo.

#### Interlude: Big News From Levely[]

After the Levely ended, most of the royalty return to their countries, including the  Neptune Family. However, at the  World Economy News Paper headquarters,  Morgans oversaw his workers frantically covering the massive events that had reportedly happened at the conference, including a death and assassination attempt.  Attach handed Morgans a letter from the  World Government containing bribe money to keep him from printing certain news, but Morgans refused to censor anything. Attach then pulled off his face to reveal that he was actually a  Cipher Pol agent in disguise, and he attempted to silence Morgans by force, but Morgans quickly defeated him.

The news was printed out, and the Revolutionaries,  Sterry,  Makino, and the  Dadan Family were aghast after reading a news story about  Sabo. At the same time, people found out that the Seven Warlords of the Sea system had been abolished after  Nefertari Cobra and  Riku Doldo III proposed it and the majority of the world leaders supported it. As a result of this, large  Marine fleets and forces were sent after Mihawk,  Hancock,  Buggy, and Weevil. On the way to  Amazon Lily,  Captain  Koby received a report from X Drake, who was secretly an undercover Marine and captain of their  SWORD unit. Drake revealed to him that Kaidou and Big Mom had formed an alliance and that he had seen CP0 in Wano.

On  New Marineford,  Sakazuki reported to Fujitora about Kaidou and Big Mom's alliance, and  Brannew and  Sengoku briefed a room of Marines about the situation. Sengoku explained that 40 years ago, powerful pirates gathered on Hachinosu to band together to take over the world, forming the  Rocks Pirates. Kaidou, Big Mom, and Whitebeard were all part of this crew, and they were led by  Rocks D. Xebec. The Rocks Pirates met their downfall 38 years ago during the  God Valley Incident, where, unbeknownst to the public,  Garp teamed up with Gol D. Roger to stop Rocks from threatening the  World Nobles and their slaves. Big Mom and Kaidou's alliance would be the greatest threat to the world since that, as they had grown much stronger since their time with Rocks, and their combined  bounties would be greater than even Roger and Whitebeard's bounties of over 5,000,000,000. Sakazuki then arrived and said that they could not take action on Wano at the moment, as they did not have enough forces to mount such a venture. Sengoku understood, though pointed out that the unaffiliated country was unusually important in all of this, especially since Oden, the former Whitebeard Pirate and Roger Pirate, came from there.

#### Third Act[]

On the day of the Fire Festival, Wano Country began its celebration. Orochi set sail toward Onigashima with Fukurokuju, leaving Kyoshiro and the Mimawarigumi in charge of the capital. Meanwhile, Kin'emon's group reached Tokage Port, only to find the place wrecked and their allies nowhere to be found and unable to contact them. Desperate, they cursed their luck as they planned to have the small group depart alone, questioning what could have happened on the night before.

Two days before the Festival, as Kin'emon rallied his allies, Orochi made plans of his own, sending men to destroy several bridges that connect the Wano regions and the hiding spot of the Thousand Sunny, cutting off the alliance from the Scabbards. Meanwhile, Holed'em discovered the recent theft from the farm and confronted the residents of Okobore Town. After the citizens took the blame, the town was burned down. Despite Momonosuke's pleas, the Scabbards decided to follow their plan, knowing that they would not get another chance. Momonosuke then asked them what he would do without them, and they told him that his father also started out alone, before finding and inspiring the Scabbards to became samurai.

41 years ago, in a brimming and flourishing Wano, the former Shogun Kozuki Sukiyaki prepared to disown his 18-year-old son Kozuki Oden due to his outrageous actions he had committed during his life. Meanwhile, Oden, who had returned from one of his failed attempts to go to sea, was enraging some citizens by cooking a pot of oden over a man's cremated remains. A young Kin'emon stole a valuable white boar from a gang and fled to the Flower Capital. Denjiro, however, told him that the wrath of his parents, known as the  Mountain God, would await those who would not return it. Just as the Mountain God  attacked the capital, Oden overheard their conversation and told them to give him the boar.

The Mountain God then attacked the capital, and after finding out it ate Tsuru, Kin'emon tried to attack the God in vain. Oden approached the Mountain God with the  boar's offspring and cut the Mountain God in half with his  Oden Two Sword Style. Since he possessed the white boar, he took the blame for it. He received a message from his father Sukiyaki, telling him he had been disowned and exiled from the capital. When Oden happily set off, Kin'emon and Denjiro became his followers. The trio went to Hakumai to meet the daimyo Shimotsuki Yasuie, who introduced them to his  new servant.

Within two years after he has been exiled, Oden, Kin'emon, and Denjiro parted ways with Yasuie and started touring through Wano Country, with Oden wanting to explore the lawless Kuri. They were joined by the siblings  Izou and Kikunojo, as well as the homeless Kanjuro and Raizo. One day, Oden went off to confront the criminals in Kuri, where he defeated all criminals and their boss, the most dangerous criminal in Wano, Ashura Doji. He then decided to take over the region, and together with his followers, he worked to round up the criminals and restore order. Once he accomplished this, Sukiyaki reinstated him as his son, as well making him daimyo of Kuri. Oden, needing retainers as a daimyo, then decided to grant his followers the position of retainers.

Six years later, as the former members of the Rocks Pirates started forming their own crews in the outside world, Kawamatsu discovered Inuarashi and Nekomamushi, who were washed up on Kuri Beach. They left  Zou 33 years ago to find Wano Country. After they washed up on Kuri Beach and were found by Kawamatsu, they were bullied by some citizens, believed to be demons. But they were saved by Oden, who stopped the citizens, and the three of them became his followers. Oden then started to run out of money, so his followers went out to steal money from Yasuie. They were caught, but to their surprise he gave them his money with the order to improve their social standing to increase Oden's respectability. They were successful in it, and three years later they were able to create a formal procession during Oden's visit to Sukiyaki in the Flower Capital.

Later that year, Oden discovered that the Whitebeard Pirates had washed ashore on Wano. He raced toward them and clashed with Whitebeard, with the intention to join his crew. Whitebeard, however, refused to let Oden join his crew, due to being concerned about his character. However, when he tried to covertly set sail at night, both Oden and Izou stowed away by riding on a chain. Whitebeard agreed to let Oden join his crew if Oden could ride the chain for three days. Oden accepted the challenge but when there were only ten minutes left, he ended up drifting away. He then washed ashore on an island, scaring away a  band of human traffickers who had tried to kidnap a woman named Amatsuki Toki with the promise to take her to Wano. After she treated his wounds, Oden protected her when the traffickers returned with their leader  Karma. Whitebeard then came and took out Karma when he offered Oden to join his crew, as he was impressed by Oden's willingness to protect Toki.

Oden, Toki, Izou, and the stowaways Inuarashi and Nekomamushi then sailed and adventured with the Whitebeard Pirates and one day, Toki revealed she was a time traveler who was born 800 years ago. Meanwhile, Gol D. Roger read the news of Oden joining Whitebeard and expressed his desire to meet Oden. As they sailed with the Whitebeard Pirates for four years and learned more about the world, Oden and Toki fell in love and Toki gave birth to Momonosuke and Hiyori.

However, several years ago in Wano, Orochi met an  old woman who could  change her appearance. She told him how the  Kurozumi Family came close to seizing power before falling and offered him to help him to take the title of shogun. Orochi had amassed wealth by stealing and borrowing from Oden and Yasuie, and the old woman posed as Oden to get him a job in the shogun's castle by lying that he and Orochi were like brothers. As Sukiyaki started to ail, the old woman posed as him and she decreed that Orochi would become temporary successor as shogun until Oden returned.

Meanwhile, the Whitebeard Pirates headed towards an island where a ruckus was going on. This ruckus was because of the Roger Pirates and Roger looked forward to battling Whitebeard on his final journey. The Whitebeard Pirates were then discovered by the Roger Pirates and an excited Oden rushed and attacked several Roger Pirates before being attacked by Roger himself. Roger and Whitebeard both preferred to battle each other, imbuing their blades with Haki and then clashing with a burst of Haki, shaking everything around and even the island. The Whitebeard Pirates and Roger Pirates clashed for three days and three nights. On the fourth day, however, they ended their battle and they split the loot equally between both crews. Roger then told Whitebeard about his dream of becoming Pirate King and traveling the world and asked to borrow Oden for a year in exchange for all his treasure. The Roger Pirates later reached  Skypiea and Oden wrote Roger's message beside the  Shandora Poneglyph.

After leaving Skypiea, the crew eventually traveled to  Fish-Man Island, where they met  Neptune and  Shyarly, who prophesied future events. Neptune then took the Roger Pirates to the Poneglyphs at the  Sea Forest: a Road Poneglyph and  Joy Boy's apology, but they were surprised to not find the one of the  Ancient Weapons,  Poseidon there as Skypiea's Poneglyph had said. Neptune revealed another prophecy about a  mermaid who could talk to  Sea Kings that would soon be born, and assumed it was his daughter that was also prophesied. Shyarly then told Roger per his request that the  Mermaid Princess would be born in 10 years, much after Roger's death.

While adventuring in the  New World, Toki came down with a fever and collapsed.  Crocus stated that she could not continue sailing in that state, and the crew decide to dock at Wano for Toki to stay there. Upon arrival, Oden's family were greeted by his retainers who asked him to stay as well and rule Wano, but Toki demanded he must not abandon his journey for her sake. Oden rejoined the Roger Pirates on his own. The crew then departed and headed to Zou to find the final Road Poneglyph.

With the transcripts of all four Road Poneglyphs, the Roger Pirates charted course to the final island, and conquered the  Grand Line, with Roger becoming the Pirate King. Oden wrote of this experience, recounting that they had discovered the truths about the  Void Century, the meaning of  D., and the Ancient Weapons, and he learned that Wano had once been connected to the outside world. He continued to describe Roger finding Joy Boy's treasure, prompting Roger to name this island " Laugh Tale."

Sometime after that, the Roger Pirates were disbanded. Roger ordered the crew to sail to someplace where the Marines were not waiting, and added that he will be the first one to leave the  Oro Jackson. After reaching an island, Roger stepped off the ship with a tearful sendoff from his crew. Afterwards, the crew headed to Wano to drop off Oden, who declared his intention to open the borders of Wano before the day that Joy Boy appears.

In Wano, Oden reunited with his family and retainers, surprised by the love and happiness the citizen showed towards him, although he had left Wano. The retainers told him about Orochi becoming shogun and how he had been oppressing the citizens with the aid of Kaidou. After hearing about how his family was threatened, a furious Oden headed to the Flower Capital. After taking out all Orochi's guards, Oden prepared to attack Orochi, who in fear warned Oden about Kaidou's revenge, but Oden continued his assault. Oden was prevented from killing Orochi by  Kurozumi Semimaru, who protected Orochi with his  Bari Bari no Mi abilities, and Oden then learned the truth about Orochi's uprising from Higurashi, who posed as Oden's father using his Mane Mane no Mi ability. His actions then resulted in Orochi's allies attacking the citizens outside and Kaidou appearing at the Flower Capital. Thus, Oden started dancing naked in the Flower Capital for five years due to a contract he made with Orochi and Kaidou, losing all the faith and trust the people of Wano had for him, until he learned that Kaidou and Orochi had deceived him. After a year, he was given the news of Roger's execution, where he both cried and laughed while reading the news. Twenty years before the present day, he learned from Orochi that Kaidou had captured Hyogoro on Orochi's orders and killed the yakuza boss' wife as well as sixteen of his men and also about Orochi's plans to make Wano a producer of weapons. This spurred Oden to take action. He and his retainers set out to defeat Kaidou, when his retainers were given their group name, the Nine Red Scabbards.

After they set out, Oden and his retainers were joined by Shinobu, who had always wanted to serve the Kozuki Family. Oden learned from Kaidou that he had placed a spy in the Flower Capital and that they had purposely made Oden dance because he was too strong at that time for Kaidou and his allies, thus weakening him and increasing their chances of victory. Oden and the Scabbards fought a ferocious battle against Kaidou and his crew in the Udon region. In the battle, Oden was able to inflict a scar on Kaidou's chest, but before he could take Kaidou out, he was tricked by Higurashi who transformed into Momonosuke and thus Oden was struck down by Kaidou. Soon after, all of his retainers were taken down as well and the battle ended with Oden and his retainers defeated. They were all imprisoned in the Flower Capital and sentenced to execution in three days by being boiled alive.

Three days later, the citizens approached the execution site and saw a large pot of boiling oil, and Oden and his Scabbards were being ushered towards it. Oden stopped and turned to face Orochi and Kaidou who were watching the event from a stage, and asked for a chance for him and his men to live. Kaidou agreed and said that if they survived an hour inside the pot, they were free to go. Oden then entered the pot and held his retainers above his head on a platform, saving them from the torture. The watchers then ridiculed Oden for his actions five years too late, and about how long it was taking him to die. Angered, Shinobu revealed the truth behind the deal Oden made with Orochi five years ago, that involved Oden dancing naked in order to stop Orochi from kidnapping and selling the citizens, and for him and Kaidou to leave Wano in five years.

Shocked by the revelation, the citizens changed their behavior and started to cheer for Oden, discovering they were surrounded by Orochi's men. Nearing the end of the set time, the citizens counted down and after an hour passed, Orochi had Oden and his men held at gun point, still in the pot. Orochi claimed to have changed the sentence a minute prior. Oden tossed his men above the crowd, saving them, and left them with his wish to open the borders of Wano to the world. Kaidou shot him and the samurai's body disappeared in the oil. Back in Kuri, news reached Toki and she recalled Oden in prison, giving her his swords for their children, and the letter he left to her before he left, asking her to use her power in preparation for a great war in twenty years' time.

Following Oden's execution, the Nine Red Scabbards raced to rescue his family in Oden Castle, which Kaidou had set ablaze as he confronted Momonosuke. Toki sent Momonosuke with Kin'emon, Kanjuro, Raizo, and Kikunojo twenty years forward in time while Kawamatsu took Hiyori to safety. Shortly after that, she appeared in front of the onlooking citizens and gave her prophecy before she died. Denjiro went to a hut, and after a long period of time emerged with his appearance having changed due to his rage. He went to the Flower Capital and started attracting followers, calling himself "Kyoshiro." As Kyoshiro, Denjiro rose to become a yakuza boss and entered Orochi's service as his bodyguard. Seven years after Oden's death, after finding Hiyori on the street, he took her in and raised her to become Komurasaki as they prepared for the day of the final battle. As Komurasaki became popular, she attracted Orochi attention, causing Denjiro to fear for her safety. He had her carry bags of fake blood on her person in preparation of faking her death to avoid the tyrant. Years later, when Kin'emon's group reached the present, Orochi and Kaidou received words of their arrival, and prepared for their counterattack, based on the intel from Orochi trusted spy, who he recruited to be his informant while preparing to live and die as a Kozuki.

As the Scabbards left Momonosuke with Shinobu, they talked about the unavoidable conclusion that one of them was a traitor, who then revealed himself to be Kanjuro. Kanjuro revealed his reasoning behind his actions, as he was a member of the Kurozumi Family, and while he has no malice towards the Scabbards, his loyalty was to Orochi. At that moment, the Scabbards boat was confronted with vessels of the Beasts Pirates, who planned to sink the Scabbards. Angered at the revelation, Kin'emon slashed Kanjuro, only to realize it was a drawing, and that the real Kanjuro had taken Momonosuke and planned on delivering him to Orochi. Just then, to everyone's shock, the Beasts Pirates ships were attacked by the Thousand Sunny and the  Victoria Punk, while the Scabbards were picked up by the  Polar Tang. The allies' ships'  captains prepared to strike back in a sea battle befitting pirates.

Just as Luffy, Law, and Kid stuck a devastating blow against the Beasts Pirates, Denjiro appeared. He cut off a large portion of the Beasts Pirates' ship and asked to bring his family to join the Nine Red Scabbards forces, revealing himself in the process. He revealed that he had released the 1,000 samurai trapped in the Rasetsu Town prison and brought them with him. Finally, he applauded Kin'emon's "plan": The two lines in Yasuie's message were not legs; they were cutting lines signifying cutting the center part out. When you remove the center kana of はぶみなと the result is はと or "wharf." In other words, the true meeting place was a wharf hidden in a forest of Habu Port, where the other 4,200 soldiers were waiting. Kin'emon, however, was unaware of such a deception.

With the entire raid forces seemingly accounted for, Kin'emon, in a sign of leadership, rallied his soldiers for the upcoming war. Shocked by their arrival, Kanjuro took Momonosuke and headed to Onigashima to report to Orochi, briefly facing off with Kawamatsu. Kanjuro, aware of Hiyori's status and hiding spot, told the  fish-man he would target her next. Riding a beautiful crane conjured through his  Fude Fude no Mi ability, Kanjuro attacked the alliance with an ink arrow raincloud. Sanji and Robin attempted to save Momonosuke, but the boy ordered the alliance to stay away and proceeded to Onigashima. Meanwhile, the Beasts Pirates' ship distanced themselves and fired at the alliance with long range cannons, destroying several of the alliances' ships. The alliance was saved with the sinking of the ship by the hand of the newly arrived  Jinbe, who introduced himself as a member of the Straw Hat Pirates.

Jinbe then boarded the Sunny, and as the crew prepared to celebrate his return, the Scabbards were joined by  Shishilian and Hyogoro as leaders of the alliance's forces to form a plan of attack. Law then suggested that they would split into four groups: One that would attack Onigashima from the front, two from each of its side, and one aboard the Polar Tang to submerge and attack Kaidou's castle at the back of the island head on. Law stated that the Straw Hat and  Kid Pirates would not listen to the plan and strike from the front, making up the first group. Kin'emon and Denjiro volunteered to be heading the groups to attack from each side, with the rest of the Scabbards on board the submarine. Law then noticed the Straw Hats were nowhere to be found, and an explosion was heard from afar, causing Denjiro to remember the guards in front of Onigashima. However, the Straw Hats were already fighting the guards, defeating them easily and looting them for the celebration of Jinbe arrival, but Luffy stopped the party, wanting to celebrate with the entire alliance once Kaidou was defeated. The Kid Pirates then sailed past them, aiming for Kaidou's head, and Luffy ordered Jinbe to catch up to them. Meanwhile, on Onigashima, the festival had commenced as Orochi, Queen, Kaidou, and Big Mom celebrated when the Tobiroppo arrived.

As Law and the Scabbards submerged, the rest of the alliance reached the entrance of Onigashima. After knocking out the guards, the Straw Hats wondered where to hide their ships as the samurai disembarked, and Luffy saw the samurai ship began to sink, with Kin'emon stating that it was done since they would not need ships for the return trip, showing his determination. As the alliance crossed a bridge, they were given disguises by Kin'emon to appear like members of the Beasts Pirates in order to blend in and avoid unnecessary battles.

Meanwhile, inland, the Beasts Pirates' celebration, the Golden Kagura, was starting with Apoo playing music and Queen performing and introducing the attendees, including the unseen Big Mom Pirates. Unimpressed by his show, the Tobiroppo sat in a booth awaiting Kaidou and began to argue among themselves about who would become Queen's replacement if he would die, causing  Ulti to lash out at her comrades. During their meeting, Kaidou confessed it was not him who summoned them, and King declared it was him who called them. Kaidou then had one of his Shinuchi,  Bao Huang, reveal his schedule, including Big Mom's crew's arrival in Wano and their alliance with the Beasts Pirates, with Kaidou revealing a very important announcement. Kaidou then told the Tobiroppo that it was their job to find his son,  Yamato, who had been missing since the beginning of the festival.  Who's-Who then asked what their reward would be if they brought him back, to which Kaidou answered that they would have the right to fight an All-Star.

Meanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates separated into smaller groups, but after hearing from Jinbe that Luffy wanted to stop Kid, since they did not know the plan, and Zoro declaring he had to find Luffy to prevent them from being spotted, Usopp, Nami, Sanji and Chopper were worried both would be lost and spotted. Outside the castle, Luffy then asked some Beasts Pirates if they had seen Kid around. They explained that they had never heard his name. Luffy noticed the massive amount of food gathered there and witnessed some Beasts Pirates spill oshiruko and make jokes about giving it to the people of Okobore Town. Enraged after seeing the spilled food, Luffy remembered how happy Tama was when she was given oshiruko on her birthday.

Furious, Luffy attacked the Beasts Pirates, drawing the attention from those around him. Zoro then arrived to lecture Luffy, and in the process drew even more attention by slicing off a building. However, after hearing Luffy's reason, Zoro joined him in rage. On the stage, Queen and Apoo figured out the identities of the invaders, and Queen offered the Beasts Pirates a chance to became one of the Tobiroppo, claiming there was someone he wanted dead, and a spot would be open, if they managed to capture the Straw Hats. With an army of Gifters approaching them, Luffy and Zoro were attacked by Apoo and were unable to identify or evade his sound-based attack. The two tried to escape but were surrounded, Apoo prepared to strike again, but Kid stepped in to attack Apoo for his treacherous actions.

With Kid's sudden appearance, the Beasts Pirates were surprised while Queen was shocked to learn another one of Babanuki's false report. Kid confronted Apoo about  their alliance, with the latter ridiculing Kid's naivety on the concept of a pirate alliance and attacked him. Queen then granted the Beasts Pirates permission to kill the intruders.  Hatcha of the Numbers joined the fight, knocking out some of his crew members. Kid was blown away and was about to be attacked, but Luffy saved him out of anger for Kid causing a riot. As the Supernovas tried to get away from the horde of enemies, they were targeted by Apoo, but thanks to Killer's intel about Apoo's powers, managed to avoid being hit by covering their ears. Above the fight, Who's-Who was talking with his men about finding Yamato because he wished to get rid of one of the Tobiroppo, which mirrored Queen's desire.

Meanwhile, Kin'emon's Eastern Forces reached the lake side Woman Trouble, a brothel under  Black Maria's rule, and decided to split their forces, with half entering the castle to corner Kaidou and Orochi, with Shinobu suggesting they would also look for Momonosuke inside. As Kin'emon led some of his men across a bridge next to the brothel, a shadow appeared in one of the windows and the samurai hid in the water. The  Brachio Tank V led by Chopper, however, was spotted by Big Mom. At the same time, the Big Mom Pirates learned about their alliance with the Beasts Pirates, but were unaware of the hidden port, as they tried to re-enter Wano via the waterfall. As they reached the top, they were once again targeted by a flying individual, who they initially believed to be King, but was Marco, who pushed the Queen Mama Chanter, sending them down the falls again. The Guardians' ship with Nekomamushi and Izou onboard ascended the waterfall.

Having given the Tobiroppo their mission, Kaidou joined the Golden Kagura celebrations with his ally Orochi and subordinate Black Maria, the latter uninterested in hunting for Yamato. Kanjuro then barged into the room, having struck through several of the Beasts Pirates who were unaware of his identity, in order to deliver a badly battered Momonosuke (who had attempted to escape his captor) to his master Orochi, following the final role given to him. Kanjuro informed Orochi about his failure in stopping the alliance's raid. Now panicked and not feeling reassured by Fukurokuju's reports, Orochi immediately ordered an execution for Momonosuke to be set up on the Live Stage, so he could finally stop worrying about the Kozuki bloodline and their prophecies.

Meanwhile, at sea, Nekomamushi and Marco made contact with the Scabbards in the Polar Tang, who informed the late comers about their meeting spot at the northwest of Onigashima. Marco got rid of the message he had told Nekomamushi to deliver to Luffy (which stated he would show up late) and then listened to the mink ruler's idea to land on Onigashima. Both the Alliance's Southern and Eastern Forces advanced further inland, with the former doing so with the "help" of Usopp and Chopper luring Big Mom away and the latter detaining  Sasaki of the Tobiroppo while directing some of his forces into the  Skull Dome. Nami,  Carrot, and Shinobu also separated from Kin'emon's group and infiltrated Black Maria's brothel, forming their own search team to locate Momonosuke. Unfortunately for them, they were suddenly spotted and ambushed by  Prometheus.

At sea,  Charlotte Perospero managed to climb the waterfall through the use of his  Pero Pero no Mi and approached Onigashima. Within Kaidou's Castle, Ulti and Page One were searching for Yamato when one of the former's tantrums caused both to literally stumble into Luffy's way. The siblings engaged Luffy in combat, activating their  Devil Fruits after sensing his impressive Haki. Somewhere else in the castle, Zoro, Kid and Killer fought off waves of Gifters. At the Live Stage, Orochi delivered a speech about Wano's history and his conflict with the Kozuki Family as Big Mom approached the location with an army of yokai-based  Homies to pursue Nami's team. Luffy managed to hold his own against the siblings until Ulti managed to hold him down. As she prepared to attack, Ulti was struck down by Yamato, who dragged Luffy away to safety.

Page One and Ulti quickly recovered from their battle with Luffy and tried to pursue Yamato, who was having a squabble with Luffy due to wanting to take him somewhere without witnesses, which the latter refused to do. Yamato took advantage of one of Luffy's attacks to escape with him into the attic, away from the Beasts Pirates' view. At sea, Law used his Devil Fruit to transport himself, some of his crewmates, and the Scabbards into Onigashima, while the remaining  Heart Pirates retreated underwater. They were soon followed by Marco carrying Nekomamushi and, unexpectedly to them, Izou, who had decided to return to his homeland. Marco temporarily left to investigate something at sea while Kikunojo had an emotional reunion with her brother.

At the Live Stage, Orochi kept talking about the Kozuki and Momonosuke's time travel. Kaidou then came onto the stage to turn the execution more interesting with his scheduled announcement: the  New Onigashima Project. Meanwhile, in the attic, Luffy listened to Yamato's story and idolatry of Kozuki Oden, having witnessed the  Legendary Hour and taken  Oden's journal. Yamato then took off his disguise, claimed that Luffy was reminiscent of Portgas D. Ace, and asked to join forces with him to take down Kaidou.

At the rear entrance of Kaidou's castle, the Scabbards sans Kin'emon and Denjiro confronted Kanjuro, who had predicted their arrival there and brought with him an assortment of Kaidou's forces as well as drawn soldiers of his own. The Scabbards entered combat with Kanjuro's troops while Kikunojo dealt with Kanjuro. Meanwhile, Yamato explained his relationship with Kaidou and the explosive cuffs that were forced into him as a way to prevent him from leaving Onigashima. Luffy offered to remove the cuffs, but right when he was about to do so, they overheard Kaidou's announcement through a projection in the room below the attic. Kaidou explained his plans to wage war against the World Government by claiming the  One Piece and the Ancient Weapons alongside Big Mom, who coincidentally entered the Live Stage with her army of yokai Homies and a captured Nami and Carrot.

Kaidou elaborated further on his course of action, planning to transform Wano Country, a natural fortress, into a lawless nation of pirates and weapon industries, operated by slaved Flower Capital denizens, to oppose the World Government. Orochi, realizing that he would lose his dominion if such an operation were put in action, angrily protested to Kaidou about the plan, only for the Emperor to instantly behead him, to the utter shock of everybody watching. Not needing to bother with either the Kozuki or Kurozumi's matters anymore and intending to have his son Yamato become the next shogun, Kaidou sent an ultimatum towards Orochi's followers: either join him and live or die fighting. Luffy and Yamato, who were eavesdropping the announcement's projection and loudly reacting to Kaidou's scheme and Momonosuke's situation, accidentally fell from the attic onto the floor below, with Yamato angered at Kaidou while Luffy followed his lead.

Outside the castle, Kikunojo managed to strike Kanjuro down. Kin'emon and Denjiro then arrived shortly after, with the former leaving his kasa over Kanjuro's body as a form of condolence. Noticing Izou's presence, Kin'emon welcomed the Whitebeard Pirates' division commander to their team as they finally invaded the stronghold. Inside the castle, Orochi's men quickly swore allegiance to Kaidou, becoming members of the Beasts Pirates. Kaidou then proposed to spare Momonosuke under the condition that he admitted that he was not Oden's son, having been previously disappointed by the boy twenty years prior. Momonosuke, in tears, admitted his heritage out of pride, even though that would lead to his execution. After spectators were surprised by an explosion produced by Yamato's then-removed handcuffs, the Nine Red Scabbards appeared behind the execution platform and managed to pounce on the Emperor before he could kill Momonosuke, officially beginning the invasion of Onigashima.

The Red Scabbards managed to penetrate Kaidou's skin, causing the Emperor to be extremely confused by it. After the Scabbards fell into the Live Stage's ground floor with Kaidou, the alliance finally showed itself to their enemies. Nami and Carrot managed to free themselves as Big Mom came into Luffy's way. The Straw Hat captain declared that he would not only emerge victorious against Kaidou, but also Big Mom and Orochi, declaring an all-out war. Kaidou began to coldly analyze the steps that the samurai had followed up to that moment thanks to the Straw Hat Pirates, accepting Luffy's proposal of a war without quarter. After transforming into a dragon and flying off, the Red Scabbards clung to the beast and flew with him to the top of Onigashima, where Nekomamushi affirmed that they knew they would get there, so they had brought all the minks, just below the full moon.

Kaidou was then joined by Jack,  Nangi and many Beasts Pirates, while the Guardians and the Inuarashi Musketeer Squad as well as all fellow minks transformed into their  Sulong forms and both parties engaged in a battle. In the Skull Dome, Shinobu tried to untie Momonosuke, but she was caught by King, and he sent her flying into a nearby building. However, to both his and Queen's surprise, Momonosuke was saved by an invisible Sanji in his Raid Suit. When King tried to stop Sanji, both engaged in a quick skirmish, however Sanji safely returned Momonosuke to Shinobu, before he was struck by King in his Zoan form into a building. Luffy was meanwhile surprised and attacked by an angry Big Mom, who attempted to summon Zeus back, but then realized Nami had managed to steal him again. This was for naught as Zeus could not defy Big Mom, who forced the cloud to not hold back against her. However, Franky and Brook arrived at the Live Stage before Zeus could hit Nami, with Franky running over Big Mom with the  Kurosai FR-U IV while Brook cut Zeus.

The Samurai led by Hyogoro and the foot soldiers of the Beasts Pirates began fighting each other. Luffy ordered Yamato to watch over Momonosuke and Shinobu as he attempted to reach the top of the dome, where Kaidou and the Red Scabbards were fighting. Franky, fearless of Big Mom, charged a , but was then surprised by the sudden appearance of three of the Numbers, with  Jaki having captured the  with Usopp and Chopper still inside. Franky changed targets at the last second and blasted Jaki in order to release his creation and friends, but that left his back vulnerable to Big Mom, who was ready to cut him with  Napoleon. Fortunately for him, Jinbe and Robin arrived at the scene and together managed to drive Big Mom away, saving Franky and allowing him to dock his two vehicles into the  General Franky. As this happened, Luffy met with Zoro at the Live Stage's performance spot, ignoring Queen and trying to launch themselves to the hole in the ceiling. The All-Star, however, did not allow them to proceed, catching them while in brachiosaurus form and throwing them back down. Sanji, who had managed to survive King's attack thanks to the Raid Suit, joined with them as King himself formed an aerial blockade of flying Gifters. The Straw Hats, now fully gathered, were told by their captain to back him up as he attempted to reach the top of the dome once more.

Having been freed by Big Mom's stray slash attack destroying the tree he was tied up to, Sasaki took note of Kaidou's fight with the Scabbards and the Mink Tribe at the top of the Skull Dome, cursing his former friend Kyoshiro for betrayal. There, The Mink Tribe in their Sulong form valiantly fought against Jack and his forces, with Inuarashi and Nekomamushi stepping up to fight him after transforming themselves. At the Live Stage, the Straw Hats engaged  Goki and  Juki in combat. As this was happening, King contacted the Tobiroppo to postpone the Yamato search and focus on the battle happening right now. X Drake, who was with Basil Hawkins in a room at the castle, was approached by Who's-Who, who proposed a team up between the two of them to take down Queen. This turned out to be a trap as both Who's-Who, Hawkins and Queen were aware of Drake freeing Trafalgar Law at the Flower Capital. With his cover blown and having nowhere to run, Drake fought his way into the Live Stage, where he attacked Juki at the same moment Luffy knocked Goki down. Aware of Luffy's benevolent reputation through Koby, Drake requested to join forces with him, which Luffy accepted, much to the protest of some of his crewmates.

Recognizing Luffy as the man they had fought earlier, Page One and Ulti attempted to block his way to Kaidou, but were distracted away by Nami and Usopp. Scratchmen Apoo also showed up and tried another surprise attack through his Devil Fruit ability but was foiled by Luffy's advanced Kenbunshoku Haki. Disappointed about the defeat of three of the Numbers, Apoo ordered Hatcha to fight as well. However, thinking that  looked like a toy, the Number was lured outside the Live Stage by Franky. Meanwhile, Zoro and Drake dueled due to the former's mistrust of the latter, but eventually decided to team up in order to prevent Apoo from summoning more Numbers. The two were then assaulted by Queen, who was targeting them from the castle's balcony.

At the top of the Skull Dome, Inuarashi and Nekomamushi managed to defeat Jack. The rest of the Mink Tribe, due to the All-Star and the strain of Sulong, were left without the strength to continue and collapsed, the same applying to Nangi and the Beasts Pirates' foot soldiers. Kaidou ordered Jack to tend himself as he attempted to burn the Scabbards with his  technique. Kin'emon, however, was able to  cut the fire in half as well as a portion of Kaidou's mouth, declaring that neither he nor his fellow Scabbards were going to run away, being ready to die fighting. The Scabbards proceeded to land several hits on Kaidou, including slashing the scar Oden had previously given him. Meanwhile, at Onigashima's front entrance, Big Mom reunited with her eldest son, Perospero, who had joined forces with Marco to infiltrate the island. Once Big Mom reaffirmed her own alliance with Kaidou, Perospero dissolved his alliance with Marco.

Despite the Scabbard's best efforts, their attacks ended up amounting to nothing as Kaidou confidently told them they would not be able to defeat him, right before counterattacking and amputating one of Kikunojo's arms. In the Skull Dome, as Luffy, Sanji and Jinbe proceeded to the rooftop while fighting several Gifters, Queen started a  viral outbreak in the Live Floor with the intent of creating chaos as he left the only existing vial of antibodies with Scratchmen Apoo, leading to a massive chase from all factions against the Supernova. Somewhere else, Shinobu and Momonosuke were found by Sasaki and his  Armored Division from the Beasts Pirates, who demanded Momonosuke's head due to his influence over the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance. Before Shinobu could be killed, Yamato stepped in to protect both, willing to die for them.

Marco clashes with Big Mom and Perospero tries to finish him off but is suddenly attacked by Carrot and  Wanda in their Sulong forms. Big Mom decides to leave, and heads to the Live Floor where the Ice Oni are spreading. Apoo tries to hold off the people pursuing him for the antidote but has his hands full with Zoro and Drake; meanwhile, Chopper realizes that he has contracted the virus. Elsewhere, Ulti and Page One are overwhelming Usopp and Nami, with Usopp's attacks doing little against them. After knocking out Usopp with a headbutt, Ulti agrees to let Nami live if she denies that Luffy will become the Pirate King. However, Nami refuses, and Ulti is suddenly prevented from attacking her by the arrival of Tama and Komachiyo.

Franky, with Hatcha on his trail, stumbled into Yamato's battle with Sasaki's Armored Division. Leaving Sasaki's forces for Franky to deal with, Yamato knocked Hatcha out after the latter opened a hole on the ground, with Yamato using it as an escape route while bringing the injured Momonosuke and Shinobu with him. Somewhere in the basement of Kaidou's Castle, Law found a Poneglyph, commenting that it was not the one he was looking for. Meanwhile, Luffy and Kid's groups advanced further through the floors of Kaidou's Castle, with the latter gathering scrap to use in the upcoming battle. Sanji, overhearing a woman suffering from apparent sexual harassment, decides to split up from his group in order to find the source of the voice, only to fall for Black Maria's trap.

In the Live Floor, Big Mom ignored the commotion with the Ice Oni and headed to the rooftop to rejoin Kaidou, who was violently massacring the Red Scabbards. While doing this, she let Kikunojo's cut arm fall in the Live Floor below. Zoro, distracted by his ongoing fight with Apoo and enraged that he was not assisting the Samurai, decided to unleash a finishing move on Apoo in order to obtain the antibody vial and bring Queen's stalling game to an end. As Zoro threatened Queen from afar and Marco showed up to the Straw Hats in the Live Floor, a huge earthquake struck the island of Onigashima. Yamato, who was trying to find a way out to the ocean, noticed that the island was not at sea anymore, having been brought airborne by Kaidou's power.

At the battlefield, Marco helped the plague victims by using his phoenix flames to reset the timer of the disease. Chopper, assisted by  Tristan and Dr.  Miyagi, made preparations to mass produce the antibody. However, Apoo rose again and persistently chased after the reindeer, only to find himself in Drake's jaws, who had completely transformed into his  Allosaurus form. Drake offered to protect the doctor alongside the yakuzas, while Marco volunteered to take Zoro to the roof, which the swordsman accepted. In the Left Brain Tower central passage, Franky attacked the enemy with , until Sasaki fully transformed into a  Triceratops and knocked over the robot. In the third floor Banquet Hall, Sanji attempted to flee from the partially transformed Black Maria, who ate the  Kumo Kumo no Mi, Model: Rosamygale Grauvogeli, and her female subordinates, though he seemed to be still enjoying the situation. In the Cat Café on the fourth floor, Jinbe stayed behind to face Who's-Who, the transformed  Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Saber Tiger fruit user, and his feline SMILE using underlings. Elsewhere, Ulti and Page One burst out of the castle in their fully transformed forms in search of Nami and Usopp.

Meanwhile, seeing as that they could not leave the island, Yamato hid Momonosuke and Shinobu in a storeroom, where a broken dragon statue was stored. Yamato told them the story of Luffy's older brother, Portgas D. Ace, and recollected their fight and fast friendship, as well as Ace's stories of his little brother. When Momonosuke and Shinobu learned Yamato was Kaidou's son, they at first kept their distance but eventually trusted him again. Yamato talked about what was written in Oden's journal regarding his adventures and about the future, and he then gave the journal to Momonosuke. On the battlefield, Queen ordered his subordinates to restrain Marco, who was transporting Zoro, but they were easily shaken off. Queen and King confronted Marco themselves. Marco restrained them before throwing Zoro to the roof. On the fifth floor, Luffy encountered the Mink Tribe, and thanked them for defeating all the enemy pirates blocking the way to the roof, before proceeding.

Atop the Skull Dome, Big Mom talked to Kaidou while her two homies fed on flames and the clouds. They discussed the past of how Linlin gave Kaidou his  mythical Zoan fruit, as well as capturing Robin in order for her to decipher the Poneglyph's so that they can find the One Piece. The two Emperors were soon confronted by Luffy, Zoro, Law, Kid and Killer. When Luffy noticed the fallen Samurai, he walked past the Emperors and cradled Kin'emon, who cried regretfully for being unable to defeat Kaidou and passed the torch on to Luffy. As Kaidou moved into attack Luffy, Law transported the Red Scabbards away with his ability. Luffy then dodged the attack, before countering with a , which successfully hurt the Emperor. Luffy then declared that he will surpass both Emperors and he would become the Pirate King.

All the pirates present reacted when Luffy managed to damage Kaidou, though the Emperor soon recovered and attacked with , which Luffy barely managed to dodge even with  foresight. He was immediately targeted afterwards by a  from Linlin and Prometheus, but was saved by Zoro, who used his recently learned  to cut the flames. Law then saved Luffy from Kaidou's follow-up attack with , though mainly to berate the Straw Hat captain for making it look like he was ordered to move the samurais, when that was his intention all along. After Kid teased them about this, Luffy challenged the two to a game of chicken in the face of Prometheus's , which the two captains participated in after Luffy taunted them, only for all three of them ending up getting hit by the attack. Both Zoro and Killer then attacked Kaidou with  and , though their attacks did not injure him. The captains then got up, with Luffy and Law activating  and  respectively, while Kid used . They then chained their attacks on Kaidou, with Luffy striking with , Kid crushing with  and Law using  to rain sharpened boulders on him. However, Kaidou quickly emerged in his dragon form and joined Big Mom in the sky to continue the fight.

Kaidou retaliated with , which the young pirates either evaded or deflected, while Luffy struck back with , followed immediately by Kid who slammed Kaidou into the ground with . Kaidou then attempted to chomp on Law, who easily evaded and pierced a  where he believed the heart was in the dragon. Killer then got onto Kaidou's back and did some internal damage with , until he was struck off by Big Mom and Zeus's . Kaidou then attempted to bite Killer, but then decided to redirect a  at Luffy after receiving his  to the face. Zoro had a reluctant Law place him in the way of the attack, cutting the breath before immediately retaliating with an , which ended up missing and instead cut off one of the horns from the mountain. Big Mom then had Zeus use , which hit all her opponents but proved ineffective against Luffy, who charged at the Emperors. Kaidou then hit the Straw Hat captain with , who endured the flames in order to barrage the dragon with , which pummeled him straight back into the dome.

However, the attack ended up using up all of Luffy's Haki, leaving him vulnerable to Linlin's . Zoro managed to protect Luffy from the attack, with Law using  to halt Big Mom's movements. Kid and Killer attempted to press their attacks on Kaidou, but the dragon used  to repel them, as well as lifting an immobile Luffy straight into his mouth. Zoro then used  to counter the attack, damage Kaidou and take back his captain. Kaidou, realizing Zoro possessed Enma, used  to retaliate, though his opponents either dodged or repelled the attacks. He then took on his hybrid form.

Back inside the dome, the CP0 agents who were invited by Orochi spectate the chaos quietly in their private room, while commenting on the current state of the war. Elsewhere, it is revealed that Speed, alongside Gazelleman and Daifugo (who were made into Tama's subordinates with her dangos) were the ones who brought Tama to Onigashima. Tama had created a large number of dangos while traveling to the island, with the intention of having her allies distribute it to the Gifters in the midst of battle. While Speed tricked the Gifters by claiming it was medicine developed by Queen, Daifugo and Gazelleman forced the dangos into their former comrades' mouths.

Back at Franky's battle, after a  failed to deter Sasaki, Franky managed to catch him by the horn and then flip over the dinosaur. Just as Franky was going to follow up on that attack, Sasaki's men restrained the robot. However, thanks to Usopp, Nami and Tama appearing with a horde of "tamed" Gifters in tow, Franky managed to break free. At this point, Ulti and Page One appeared in pursuit of the three, revealing to Sasaki that the Gifters were being turned against them. Ulti attempted to attack Nami, but the Cat Burglar countered with a , though it did not keep the dinosaur woman down for long. In the meantime, Usopp used  to shoot dangos into Sasaki's men mouths, turning them into the alliance's allies. While the triceratops was distracted by this turn of events, Franky kicked his head upwards, to unleash a  at his belly.

In the Grand Banquet Hall, Sanji, having defeated Black Maria's male subordinates, was finally captured thanks spider-woman's abilities and female subordinates, whom Sanji refused to hurt. He was then threatened to call for Robin via the  Mary,  Caimanlady, in order to capture her. At this point though, a  cyborg Mary discovered the injured Red Scabbards and informed King that someone was trying to help them. King requested someone else to go as his hands were full dealing with Marco, with Black Maria volunteering. Black Maria started beating up Sanji in order to force him to call for Robin, but it was unnecessary as Sanji willingly did so, much to the shock of the ladies, who thought that Sanji would be defiant to the end. Just as Black Maria was about to recommence beating up Sanji, Robin appeared and used  to knock her away, while Brook, who accompanied her, froze all of Maria's webbing. With Sanji freed, he headed towards the Scabbards, at the same time as a recovering Jack, who insisted on ending the samurais himself, leaving Black Maria to deal with Robin and Brook.

Elsewhere, Yamato's group was discovered by a cyborg Mary, which forced him to hide Momonosuke in his clothes as they made a break for it. Despite their efforts, they were still spotted by Bao Huang and her Mary's, who broadcasted their location throughout the castle. Sanji, who heard this, interrogated one of his defeated opponents, and found out that Momonosuke is virtually in the opposite direction of the Scabbards. Conflicted on who to support, Sanji eventually ran in one of their directions. Meanwhile, outside the castle, Perospero managed to defeat the two Mink women after clouds covered the moon and cancelled their Sulong. Perospero then headed indoors, as he witnessed Marco holding back King and Queen all by himself and decided to support his new allies.

In the Performance Floor, the Beasts Pirates, and their new samurai recruits persistently attempted to reach Chopper, but were forced back by the alliance, predominantly X Drake and Hyogoro, who, by a side effect of the Ice Oni virus, had regained his form and strength of his prime. However, due to the phoenix flames burning up their physical stamina in order to keep them from turning, the situation for the alliance side started to degrade, with Hyogoro even preparing to commit suicide before he turned into an Oni. Everyone started to fall into despair, including the Beasts Pirates Waiters and Pleasures, when they learnt that the Ice Oni virus was intended to be used on them as they have lost their value with the loss of SMILEs. Thankfully, in spite of Queen's insistence that the 'Tanuki' was going to abandon them, Chopper came through, firing the  into the battlefield, which cured everyone of the virus. When Queen questions what, how and why Chopper did this, the reindeer stated that thanks to his two years of training, he was able to make a gaseous virus designed to counteract the Ice Oni virus using the antibodies as a base. Queen then fired at Chopper when the Cotton Candy Lover lectured him on how weaponizing viruses would inevitably lead to them losing control over it. At this point, having felt betrayed at the fact that they were to be treated as expendables, the Pleasures put their bodies on the line to protect Chopper. Marco then restrained Queen, allowing Chopper, who used , to hit the Brachiosaurus, while declaring that he was NOT a tanuki, eliciting silent apologies from all his allies, who had been continuously calling him one.

In the Right Brain Tower, Team Momonosuke fled from the enemies when Momonosuke, in a moment of self-doubt, transformed into a dragon. After transforming back, he explained to Yamato about his ability. Yamato then expressed concern for Luffy, as well as a willingness to fight Kaidou. Momonosuke offhandedly, yet correctly, stated Luffy's current condition, evoking surprise from Shinobu, as the group was nowhere near Luffy.

Elsewhere, Orochi is revealed to be alive, and together with Fukurokuju, started setting fires around the castle for the sake of revenge. Meanwhile, in the treasure repository, the Scabbards regained consciousness, and just as they were about to leave to rejoin the battle, the door opened to reveal Oden, much to their delighted shock. However, Ashura quickly exposed that the Oden in front of them was a fake, with all of them soon realizing that it was a living painting remotely controlled by Kanjuro, who was still alive. Ashura then sacrificed himself to push away the painting before it self-destructed, while the rest ran towards Momonosuke, as they realized he was being targeted. However, they soon came across Jack, with Inuarashi volunteering to stay behind in order to fight him. The Scabbards soon came across Orochi and Fukurokuju, with the former transforming in order to take on the visibly weakened Samurai, despite the latter's insistence that they flee. This proved to be the shogun's undoing, as the Scabbards instantly decapitated six of his heads before moving on, with the exception of Raizo, who stayed behind to fight Fukurokuju.

On the rooftop, the Supernovas were all wounded, and came to the conclusion that unless they separated the two Emperors, they would never make headway. The Emperors then performed , a powerful wide-ranged, unavoidable, combo attack, which the younger pirates endured thanks to Zoro, who briefly blocked it, though he sustained some serious injuries. Luffy then attacked Kaidou with a , which the King of the Beasts quickly dodged. He then followed up by knocking down the young pirate, firing a  and then attacked with , and though Luffy barely avoided the former attack, he took the latter head on. In the meantime, Kid constructed an airtight metal box, which Law used  to trap Zeus in, while Zoro used  to neutralize Prometheus, and Killer knocked Napoleon out of Big Mom's hand and continuously attacked it in order to keep it away from its owner. Kid then got Linlin's attention by firing  at her, which Big Mom easily repelled before punching Kid into the ground. The captain used this opportunity to attach some scrap to her and used  to levitate her, which Law followed up by using  to launch a massive boulder at her, that pushed her off the island. Without any of her Homies to help her fly, Linlin plummeted into the open sea, though she was saved when Kaidou targeted Zoro, allowing Prometheus to pick up Napoleon and catch her before she could drown. As Big Mom praises Prometheus, while criticizing Zeus, the living Sun made a request to its owner. Kid and Killer then chased after Big Mom, when they noticed something strange going on in the sky.

Just as Kaidou swung at Zoro, Law used his ability and switched with the Pirate Hunter, before stabbing the King of the Beasts in the throat with . He then defended himself from Kaidou's follow up with  though he was still sent flying. Zoro, while entrusting Law with the aftermath, then used his strongest attack, , when Kaidou targeted the still unconscious Luffy. The attack managed to scar the Emperor, who was shocked, having thought that Zoro might have used Haoshoku Haki, though the swordsman denied it before collapsing. When Law attempted to help the Pirate Hunter, Kaidou struck both of them with .

Just as the Emperor thought he had dealt with all his immediate enemies, Luffy rose again while revealing the epiphany he gained from taking Kaidou's last attack, that Haoshoku Haki can also be infused into attacks. Kaidou laughed and then attacked, while stating that only the mightiest can use such a technique. However, Luffy instantly countered, using Haoshoku-infused emissive Haki attacks, chaining a kick which knocked away the kanabo, a punch to Kaidou's gut followed by an uppercut, which floored the Emperor. Luffy then thanked Zoro and Law, telling them to go down, while he himself would take on Kaidou alone. The two clashed, both using Haoshoku Haki in their attacks. Unfortunately, due to Luffy's inexperience in using Haoshoku Haki in this way, he soon lost and was sent plummeting into the sea, with Kaidou commenting that he got carried away and should have cut of his head, since without it he couldn't break the morale of the rebels.

As Big Mom descended from the sky, she is now accompanied by her new special Homie,  Hera, who she used to blast Kid and Killer with , sending them both indoors, with she herself following. Law then took Zoro and Zeus indoors with his ability, while conveniently landing near Sanji, who was headed for Momonosuke. Law quickly handed Zoro to the chef, listing out all of Zoro's injuries, before he and Zeus went their separate ways in order to look for Big Mom. After wrapping up Zoro in bandages, Sanji continued heading for Momonosuke, before into Izou and Kawamatsu. As it turned out, the Scabbards have split into smaller groups, with Nekomamushi headed for  Pedro's killer, Perospero; Kin'emon and Kiku raced to Momonosuke; while Izou and Kawamatsu offered to reinforce the others. With Momonosuke in Kin'emon's hands, Sanji took Zoro's advice and headed to the Live Floor. Meanwhile Kid and Killer, having been blasted a good distance indoors, quickly shook of the attack and started to actively look for Big Mom, though when they soon encountered Hawkins, who attempted to ambush them with . With another member of the Worst Generation in the way Killer volunteered to stay behind and fight him.

Meanwhile, on the second floor, Page One had finally caught up to Komachiyo and clung to the komainu, while Nami and Usopp desperately attempted to get him off. Usopp then used  to remove him, followed by  in an attempt to finish him, though it failed. At this point, they ran into Big Mom, who recognized the Straw Hats and Tama, the former she threatened hostilely, though the latter she surprisingly greeted gently, as according to Prometheus' thoughts, Linlin rarely entered a  Mother Mode for children under the age of ten. After she learnt of how Okobore Town, the place that helped her when she had amnesia, was burnt to the ground by Kaidou's men, she angrily knocked out the approaching Page One with a single Haoshoku-infused fist.

Ulti, who witnessed the attack, started angrily running at them. Nami attempted to turn the two angry ladies at each other, but when both still designated her a target, the Straw Hats and Tama attempted to continue fleeing on Komachiyo. However, Ulti took down the lion dog with an , and slapped Tama when the girl started crying, earning the united ire of both Linlin and Nami, the former striking the Tobiroppo executive with an electrical attack. Nami attempted to follow up with , but the dinosaur woman dodged it, caught the Cat Burglar and attempted to headbutt her. Thankfully, she was inadvertently saved thanks to Big Mom's , which pierced right through Ulti.

As the Homies celebrated their first combo attack, Zeus appeared and is saddened when he saw a new Homie in his place. When Big Mom noticed him, he attempted to join in as part of the group, but is left heartbroken when Big Mom rejected him and had Hera feed on him. As he is being eaten, he tearfully apologized to Nami, and even attempted to attack Linlin, as a means to delay the Emperor and allow Nami to escape, though he is easily squished by his former master. Nami attempted to strengthen Zeus by giving him some , but Hera seemingly ate him before he could, while also consuming Nami's clouds. Tama, having witnessed O-Lin's actions, is now scared of the Emperor, and attempted to run away with the Straw Hats, though when Big Mom sees this, in a twisted form of affection, resolved to kill Tama along with the Straw Hats. However just as she's about to attack, the Emperor is slammed into the ground by Kid's , allowing the trio to escape Big Mom. He is later joined by Law who offered a temporary alliance to Kid in order to deal with the Emperor.

In the First Floor Attic, Momonosuke was left to hide with Shinobu, while Yamato headed to the Skull Dome while hiding a makeshift Momonosuke doll in an effort to distract the enemy. In the attic, Momonosuke read his father's journal and is shocked at the conclusion, that indicated that he really couldn't afford to die. All of a sudden, as Luffy was sunk into the sea after losing to Kaidou, he used the  Voice of All Things and transmitted a message to Momonosuke, which he wished for the boy to spread to their allies, who in turn complied. As he rolled in pain from the headache of receiving the message, he was soon discovered by Kin'emon and Kiku, and promptly after by Kanjuro who used his ability to disguise himself as Oden. Though Kiku knew the truth and resolved to deal with the impostor, she still hesitated, allowing the traitor to stab her. Kin'emon then took her place and cut down Kanjuro, but then Kaidou appeared and struck down the Foxfire. As Shinobu and Momonosuke ran away, Kin'emon still attempted to fight by stabbing Kaidou with his broken blades in spite of his injuries. However, this proved to be ineffective as Kaidou impaled Kin'emon with Kiku's sword before pursuing Momonosuke. As the Kozuki heir was carried away by Shinobu, he used a frog Mary he snatched to transmit Luffy's message throughout Onigashima, urging that Alliance to continue fighting, and that the Straw Hat captain would return to the fight and would win. At this point, Kaidou cornered the two, but before he could attack them, Shinobu used her Juku Juku no Mi ability to rot of the edge of the island and fall off Onigashima. Yamato then challenged Kaidou from atop the Skull Dome, not only to break their bonds, but also to buy Luffy some time. Kaidou then flew to the top of the Skull Dome in his dragon form before entering his hybrid form to fight Yamato.

On the Live Floor, Chopper was fighting the fully transformed Queen, slamming the Brachiosaurus on his back while in Monster Point. However, as Queen was getting support from Perospero, the battle was not going in their favor. Queen then shot a  beam from his mouth at Chopper which the reindeer managed to dodge, before charging at the Plague, though Queen countered by cybernetically extending his neck to bite Chopper. At this point, Bao Huang transmitted the message of Luffy's defeat and "death", at Kaidou's hand which affected the Alliance's morale. Perospero immediately followed up by shooting , a shower of candy arrows which fell randomly all over the Live Floor. Thankfully, Sanji appeared as Queen is about to inflict a dangerous attack on Chopper and kicked the All-Star with  which sent him spinning, simultaneously deflecting all the arrows with the enemy's massive body while also knocking back Perospero. He then chucked Zoro to Chopper to have him attend the swordsman wounds, while he took over their doctor's fight. The Alliance then heard Momonosuke's message which restored their morale.

As Nami, Usopp and and Tama kept running toward the stage, they found out that Zeus is now inhabiting Nami's  Clima-Tact. As it turned out, Nami's effort to help Zeus earlier wasn't in vain, as just as Hera was about to eat him, Nami's parting gift of  ended up pushing his soul into the Clima-Tact, turning it into a sentient weapon. Just as they reached the stage, Ulti caught up with the trio and head-butted Usopp into the ground. She caught Tama, and having realized that she was the one responsible for the Gifters' and Big Mom's actions, started to strangle the girl. Nami attempted to attack the Tobiroppo by hitting her with the stretched out Clima-Tact, but was surprised when Zeus transformed the end into a mace. Zeus then stated that though Ulti's skin is tough, her insides must be heavily damaged, and she'd just need one more strong attack to be taken down. Usopp then hits Ulti with , causing a massive number of seaweeds to grow on her, and separating her from Tama, allowing Nami to use  on her, though Ulti still managed to dodge it. However, Zeus showed his worth by redirecting the attack and homing in on Ulti, knocking her out.

This quick battle all happened before Bao Huang, who was so surprised, that instead of announcing the original message of how Momonosuke fell off the island, she instead blurted out about how Page One and Ulti were both taken out, inadvertently affecting her own side's morale. Usopp then captured her using , before having Tama use the Mary's to transmit her own voice.

Though Tama was at first intimidated by Queen, she eventually managed to convey her orders to all the Gifters who consumed her dangos, which again shifted the tides of battle in favor for the Alliance. Queen, realizing that Tama was behind this, attempted to attack her, but was stopped by Sanji's . Tama then ran away with Nami and Usopp, as they were targeted by the Beasts Pirates, believing her to be the one responsible for the Gifters' betrayal, though she was later protected by Daifugo, carried away by Speed, while Gazelleman promised to take care of Komachiyo. Zeus, who was elated now that Nami accepted him as her partner, cleared the way for their escape. Back at the Performance Floor, Queen then shifted into his man-beast form while revealing several of his cyborg modifications, while also touching on his and Sanji's father's past in  MADS. Chopper, who had turned into his new  Babyjiji form under the modified  Rumble Ball's side effects, discussed with Miyagi about the goat Mink's hidden ultra-regenerative medicine and it's side effect. Zoro, having heard this, demanded to have the medicine at once, due to his urgent need to rejoin the battle.

Back in the Cat Café, where Jinbe faced Who's-Who, the former Warlord initially had a hard time, due to facing not only the Tobiroppo, but all his subordinates as well. However, mass confusion occurred when the Tama's ability activated and the Gifters started turning against each other, forcing the officer to face Jinbe in a one-on-one. Who's-Who then revealed himself to be a  Rokushiki user, using a dagger to fire some , which Jinbe countered with . The officer dodged the attack with  followed by a , which Jinbe deflected using a Busoshoku hardened arm. As he transformed into his Man-Beast form, Who's-Who disclosed himself to be an ex- CP9 agent who was imprisoned after making a mistake thirteen years ago, and managed to escape to form his own pirate crew. He then fired a  at Jinbe, which the Fish-Man dodged. The Saber-toothed tiger then revealed that the grudge he held for Jinbe is connected to the Fish-man's new captain, the one who ate the  Gomu Gomu no Mi, the fruit which the former agent allowed to be stolen by the  Red Hair Pirates. He then took to the sky using , before raining down a barrage of , which Jinbe dodged after deflecting one and seeing that his Busoshoku was unable to fully block it. Who's-Who then charged at his opponent with , which Jinbe countered with , followed by an , though Who's-Who dodged it with . He then continued his conversation as they fought, inquiring Jinbe on what he knew about  Nika, the Sun God, who was talked about by the slaves while he was tortured during captivity. He then attacked up close, barraging Jinbe with , stating that he believed the Fish-Man would know, as he was once a part of the  Sun Pirates, and the Fish-Men history of  slavery. Angered by this final comment, Jinbe used a full body Busoshoku hardening strong enough to actually break the Tobiroppo's fingers, before gripping onto his opponent's wrists and using . Who's-Who then attempted to escape using  and  at point blank range, but Jinbe simply endured it, before stepping on his opponent's tail and finishing him with .

Throughout all this, the CP0 agents examined the state of the war in their private Guest Parlor, using a Go board to illustrate the two sides. They noted that a total of 5,000 casualties have appeared on both sides, with the ratio between Beasts Pirates and the Alliance being 24,000:3,000. However, thanks to Queen causing the Pleasures and Waiters on his own side to revolt, the gap is actually smaller, being 20,000:7,000. When Tama activated her ability, the CP0 agents altered the board again, with 300 Headliners being tamed by Tama, with an additional 2,000 Gifters under their direct command turning against the Beasts Pirates, and a thousand additional casualties during the surprise betrayal, the gap narrowed again with 16,000:9,000 in favor of the Beasts Pirates. The agents then discussed how Who's-Who needed to be eliminated due to his defection.

In the sea surrounding Wano, after Luffy used the Voice of All Things to talk to Momonosuke, he used it again to call the Heart Pirates to save him. While they were confused on how they could hear the unconscious, drowning captain's voice, they still took him aboard the Polar Tang and attempted to resuscitate him. Though they managed to get all the water out of his body, they debated on what to do next as the Straw Hat captain was still unconscious, when Luffy revived himself and yelled for meat, much to his allies' shock.

In the Right Brain Tower, Franky had no choice but to run while fighting due to the disadvantage in numbers. However, after Tama activated her ability, Franky gained new allies in the Gifters. This allowed him to fight Sasaki one-on-one, where they both landed powerful blows on each other. Getting irritated on each other's toughness, Sasaki entered his Man-Beast form while also activating his  Karakuri Rasento, before rotating his frill which allowed him to hover. He then attacked his tamed subordinates with , before attacking Franky with the same move. Though Franky managed to deflect the attack, Sasaki then prepared himself to charge at the mecha while spinning his frill for extra propulsion, but accidentally spun it in the wrong direction causing him to move backwards instead. The embarrassed Tobiroppo clumsily attempted to claim he did it on purpose to acquire runway space, though Franky called him out on this. Sasaki then charged at Franky with , which the Franky Shogun attempted to counter with , though the collision ended up accidentally launching the mecha's shoulder-mounted rockets point black into the dinosaur man's face. Franky used this opportunity to perform a , planting Sasaki head-first into the floor and attempted to follow it up with a  at Sasaki's unprotected and heavily bleeding belly, though the triceratops used his rotating frill to escape skywards. They then engaged in a swordfight, which proves to be Franky's weakness, as his Franken was soon snapped, forcing Franky to retreat as he prepared a . Sasaki then charged at Franky with another , but Franky managed to fire his cannon in time, sending Sasaki flying. However, this was still not enough to take the Tobiroppo down, who performed an aerial kamikaze attack, , which successfully broke the Franky Shogun. Thankfully, Franky had already evacuated from the mecha, and ended the battle by launching a  directly at Sasaki's unprotected stomach.

On the roof of the Skull Dome, Kaidou told Yamato whilst fighting him that he would make a worthy addition to the Beasts Pirates' military strength, causing him to retort that that is no way for a parent to talk to their child. Kaidou told Yamato that the Devil Fruit he consumed was one he had had a tough time acquiring, and that he never planned on letting Yamato have it. Yamato told him that he ate it out of hunger and that now he cannot swim, even though he wanted to set sail. Yamato told Kaidou that even though he failed to kill him multiple times, all of his defeats have made him stronger, and that the explosive cuffs were not the only thing keeping him in Wano. Yamato declared that if he just abandoned the country, he could not call himself Oden. Kaidou stated that the  Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Okuchi no Makami is a rare mythical wolf and Wano's guardian deity, so it was a mistake to let Yamato eat it but also should mean that he has to protect Wano for him. Yamato, however, planned to help protect the country from Kaidou and open its borders. He then unleashed a  at his father, which Kaidou countered with , saying he would not let that happen.

In the Banquet Hall, Black Maria caught Brook and Robin in her , which made them see illusions of their deceased loved ones. Brook, who had gotten used to such things after decades of loneliness in the  Florian Triangle, called out to Robin who is seemingly fooled by it and was approaching the images of  Nico Olvia, Professor  Clover and  Jaguar D. Saul. However, Robin knew better and attacked the illusions with  revealing them to be the Gifters  Tenjo-Sagari,  Nure-Onna and the Numbers  Kunyun respectively. The two Straw Hats then quickly retreated, as they were pursued by the Beasts Pirates, including Black Maria herself who attacked with , which the two dodged. Maria then set the floor on fire, forcing Robin to carry Brook and escape to the ceiling using . Seeing that the true identity of the burning polearm is a  Pug Gifter running inside the wheel and generating flames, Brook used  to freeze him, before putting out the fires on the floor using . Now back on the floor, Brook offered to take care of Maria's subordinates, leaving Robin to take care of the Tobiroppo, which she gratefully accepted. As Maria mocked Sanji for his pathetic display before, Robin merely smiled, as she understood that he did it not because he was afraid to die or to betray her, but because he trusted her. She then used  to create a giant clone of herself as well as several giant arms, before using  to grab onto Maria's spider legs. However, Maria fought back and having quickly realized that Robin will take any damage her clone does, she coated her feet with poison, forcing Robin to let go. Maria then used , using her webbing to restraint , before coming in close and punching with . Robin soon dispersed the clone, before attempting to use giant arms to restraint Maria from behind. However, the Tobiroppo noticed this and blocked with , before setting her new webbing aflame with , cornering Robin within the fire. As Maria took advantage of this and launched a barrage of attacks on Robin, while taunting her, claiming that she was a liability, Robin recalled her Fish-Man Karate lessons when she was with the Revolutionary Army.

She then sprouted a gigantic hand on Black Maria's back and attacked the ceiling with  to collapse it and put out the flames. She then used to create a giant demonic looking clone of herself to finish of Black Maria with . Meanwhile, in order to impede his opponents, Brook made a very narrow passage in between two large ice blocks he created. When Maria screamed as she was defeated by Robin, her worried subordinates all crowded around the narrow gap. Brook then suddenly collapsed the ice, and with all the subordinates' lined up, he defeated them simultaneously with . He then rushed to support Robin as she collapsed from her wounds and exhaustion.

Down in Tokage Port, Momonosuke and Shinobu had safely landed thanks to Shinobu's kite, and reunited with Luffy and the Heart Pirates. The pirates had given Luffy all of their food, yet he still demanded more, forcing them to go look for it. Fortunately, they ran into Caribou who was close by and was carrying months' worth of provisions within his  swamp, which he willingly offered to them in order to ensure their victory so that he can finally leave Wano. Momonosuke was relieved to see Luffy alive and started to cry over Kin'emon's and Kikunojo's fate, but Luffy told him to not cry yet until Kaidou is beaten. He then pointed up into the air and told Momonosuke to turn into a dragon and fly him back up to Onigashima. In order to do this, Momonosuke requested Shinobu to mature his body into an adult with her ability.

Though Onigashima was only fifteen minutes away from reaching the Flower Capital, and the Tobiroppo confirmed to have been defeated, battles still continue across the island. On the third floor in the castle, Raizo duel with Fukurokuju continued, with Raizo using  while he asked his opponent how he could serve someone like Orochi. Fukurokuju mocked the ninja's emotional state and willingness to follow a dead man as he landed a hit on the real Raizo with his . As the battle continued, the two ninjas' quarreled over Momonosuke's suitability to become the shogun of Wano, due to his young age. Elsewhere on the live floor, Killer managed to destroy all but one of Hawkins' straw dolls which transfer damage to another person. Killer then sliced at Hawkins but as the Magician redirected the injury to his final doll, he cryptically told the Massacre Soldier to consider whose life the doll was attached to, before revealing that the final straw doll was tied to Kid's life. Simultaneously, as Kid and Law fought Big Mom, Kid was sliced out of nowhere. Hawkins took pleasure in Killer's dilemma and wondered what he would decide to do.

On the Performance Floor, King and Queen rampaged mercilessly against the defected Beasts Pirates, with Sanji being overwhelmed and Marco exhausted. Sanji nervously waited for Miyagi's treatment of Zoro to take effect as he resumed attacking Queen. From a distance, Perospero attempted to snipe Sanji with a candy arrow, blaming the cook for forcing him to team up with the Beasts Pirates, but was attacked by Nekomamushi who arrived to avenge Pedro. Some samurai attempted to take Zoro to safety, but were confronted by King, who used ; however, Marco is able to hold off the attack with his  long enough for the treatment to take effect. The now-healthy Zoro then struck King with  while Sanji simultaneously attacked Queen with , with the two of them stating that they would catch a glimpse of Luffy as the Pirate King once this battle was won. The two Lead Performers soon stood back up after Zoro and Sanji's attacks with Queen recommencing the battle with a barrage of lasers. As the two Straw Hats dodged the shots, Zoro noticed something wrong with Sanji, who revealed that he had felt strange ever since last using the Raid Suit. Zoro then blocked an attack from King meant for Sanji, with the Black Leg quickly returning the favor by defending the Pirate Hunter from Queen's . When Sanji displayed , Queen started claiming that he was a  modified human, though Sanji vehemently insisted that he was completely human, unlike his brothers. As Zoro clashed with King, the Wildfire's blade suddenly revealed its gimmick, turning into a swordbreaker and disarming the Pirate Hunter of two of his blades. King then followed up with a punch, though Zoro managed to defend with the sword in his mouth, before reclaiming his blades.

In the distance, Marco thought back to a story Whitebeard told him about a land of gods, when Izou rescued him from some Beasts Pirates and carried him out of the fight. The samurai, realizing that attempting to support the Straw Hats in their battles would be futile, instead turned to suppressing the other Beasts Pirates and preventing them from interfering in the Straw Hats-Lead Performer battles. As the fight continued, Hyogoro and Kawamatsu remarked about the similarities between Zoro and his resemblance to Shimotsuki Ushimaru and Shimotsuki Ryuma even stating that the swordsman returning Shusui to Wano could be considered fate.

Meanwhile, on the second floor, Jack fought Inuarashi in his hybrid form, when the dog mink managed to throw Jack into the courtyard where Ashura Doji laid. As Inuarashi claimed that he was fine dying for the incoming dawn of the world, he stepped into a sliver of moonlight and transformed into his Sulong form. At the front entrance of Onigashima, Carrot and Wanda had recovered to see Nekomamushi approach Perospero in his Sulong form. He spoke to the already deceased Pedro, telling him to sit back and watch him win the fight.

Elsewhere on the second floor, Usopp bluffed the Beasts Pirates, claiming responsibility for the blasts of Haoshoku Haki knocking out the enemy (which was actually being emanated from Big Mom who was fighting elsewhere on the floor), while dubbing himself “Usohachi the Sibling Hunter”, asserting that he was the one who defeated Page One and Ulti. This also distracted them from Tama and Nami, the latter who was attempting to communicate with her crewmates and learn their status. In the Right Brain Tower, Franky had reunited with the Heart Pirate allies, and were together preventing the Beasts Pirates from trying to enter the Performance Floor. On the Third Floor, Brook attempted to flee from the out-of-control flames, with an unconscious Robin in his arms, while Jinbe fought alongside the Kid Pirates on the fourth floor and the samurai blockaded the entrance to the Performance Floor.

Down in Tokage Port, Shinobu used her ability to permanently mature the boy's body to 28 years of age. The Heart Pirates started panicking when a dragon appeared before them, believing it to be Kaidou, though Luffy recognized the creature to be none other than Momonosuke. When Luffy asked Momonosuke whether he is ready to fly him back to Onigashima, the dragon emphatically agreed, though when Luffy got on him and demanded he flew, Momonosuke froze up and refused to fly due to his acrophobia.

Meanwhile, atop the Skull Dome, with both father and child still in their hybrid forms, Yamato fired a  which Kaidou easily deflected before launching a  in return that his son barely managed to defend against. As Yamato exhaustively stated that his father was trying to kill him, Kaidou passively affirmed this, saying that it was the burden of carrying Oden's name. Yamato verbally defended his admiration as he recalled the past, when he first awakened his Haoshoku Haki. Having unintentionally knocked out some of his father's men, Kaidou properly recognized him as a potential threat with his mindset and locked him up in a cave with samurai who rebelled against him. Claiming to give them an opportunity to join him if they surrender, he left a single portion of food and the samurai's swords, believing they would either fight each other for the food, or kill Yamato for being his son. What neither parent nor child expected was that, once the cave was sealed, the samurai instead claimed their blades, cut the boy free of his chains and give him the only portion of food. With their actions and mutual admiration for Oden, Yamato put his trust in them, and revealed Oden's logbook, asking them to teach him what was written. Ten days later, with Yamato close to starving to death, the samurai decided to break out of the cave in order to secure Yamato's future, who promised to fight for Wano when the predicted war came, with their actions leading to their death. Back in the present, Yamato demanded to know what right Kaidou had to steal Wano's and his own freedom, with his father replying that there is no easy answer, as they clashed with simultaneous . Yamato managed to defend against the blow with , before immediately following up with  though Kaidou quickly got up and went on the offensive, while claiming that even if he fought for Wano, no one would truly accept him as he is his blood, and that anyone who did support him died.

In the skies around Onigashima, Momonosuke has finally taken flight, however, due to his fear of heights, he refused to open his eyes as he flew. This ended up making him crash straight into the castle and straight through the Performance Floor, before ascending into the second and then third floor, before managing to get back outside, briefly shocking everyone who saw him in the process. When they were back above the Skull Dome, Luffy pointed out Kaidou, which made Momonosuke open his eyes and fly straight at the Emperor. Though Kaidou himself noticed the commotion Momonosuke caused below, he attributed it to Big Mom.

With both father and child now back in their human forms, Yamato, resolved for things not to end like this, stood back up and prepared to attack. Kaidou, noticing something large flying in the distance behind him, was briefly distracted which allowed Yamato to get close. Simultaneously, as Momonosuke flew towards Kaidou, Luffy briefly entered  and launched a , which landed at the same time as Yamato's , the attacks sending the Emperor flying back. Yamato, having finally noticed his allies, briefly celebrated their reunion before a fully transformed Kaidou recovered and demanded to know how Luffy survived and who the peach dragon is. As Luffy declared himself to be the man who will be Pirate King, Momonosuke screwed up his courage to reveal himself to be the future shogun, to which Kaidou in turn proclaimed that there was no need for two dragons. Kaidou then fired his , which Momonosuke desperately evaded. Luffy then told the pink dragon to bite Kaidou, before jumping of him to land a  on the King of the Beasts, driving his head into the ground. Though Momonosuke pessimistically tried to avoid doing as Luffy said, recalling all the trauma Kaidou made him go through, the pink dragon gathered his courage and bit his blue counterpart. Just as Kaidou threatened to attack Momonosuke, Luffy punched the blue dragon away, before asking the young shogun whether, after biting an Emperor, there was anything in the world he was afraid of, which Momonosuke enthusiastically declared no. Luffy then told Momonosuke to stop Onigashima alongside Yamato, declaring he would definitely win. Kaidou then entered his hybrid form, before he and Luffy clashed with Haki, which ended up splitting the clouds. As Momonosuke and Yamato made their leave, Kaidou attempted to stop them. Yamato managed to defend the two from Kaidou's attack, long enough for Luffy to restrain the Emperor, allowing Momonosuke to fall off the edge of the Skull Dome.

Unbeknownst to the group above, a human Mary had arrived on the Skull Dome, and broadcasted Momonosuke's identity as the peach dragon and Luffy's declaration of victory, which raised the morale of the alliance, before the broadcast was cut after she was knocked out by the pirates Haoshoku Haki clash. Just prior to the clash, the moon was covered, which deactivated Inuarashi and Nekomamushi's Sulong, which ended up giving their opponents the advantage. However, after the Haoshoku clash split the heavens, the two Minks were able to reactivate Sulong allowing Inuarashi to defeat Jack with  and Nekomamushi to take out Perospero with  respectively.

As Momonosuke fell, Yamato coached him on how dragons fly using , which the young shogun quickly picked up. They then noticed the bedrock starting to fall, which Yamato realized meant that Kaidou's control over the  supporting the island has loosened due to the Emperor himself weakening. They realized that if Kaidou were to be defeated, the island would plummet immediately, endangering not only the citizens in the Flower Capital but everyone on Onigashima. Furthermore, if the massive number of explosive weapons stocked on Onigashima were set off by the impact, the fatalities would further increase. Momonosuke attempted to physically push the island back, but Yamato dissuaded him, claiming a better idea would be for the peach dragon to produce Flame Clouds superior to Kaidou's and support the island with those. Momonosuke started getting pessimistic again, believing that his inexperience and the difference between himself and Kaidou would make it impossible to achieve such a feat, and proposed to instead stop Luffy from fighting. Yamato angrily knocked the dragon's head in response, believing that informing the captain of such a thing would only burden him, and that it would be up to two of them to stop Onigashima. He then assigned Momonosuke to create the , while he headed to the Armory in the basement to reduce the damage. Yamato then climbed up the side of Onigashima in his hybrid form, before transforming into his wolf form in order to reach the Armory as quickly as possible. In the meantime, Momonosuke at first desperately attempted to create  bit-by-bit. However, he quickly found that it would be faster to simply manipulate Kaidou's pre-existing  instead.

In the Guest's Parlor, the CP0 agents were contacted by  Rob Lucci, where  Guernica informed the others of the second dragon fighting for the alliance, which was most likely Vegapunk's failed  Artificial Devil Fruit. However, the off-island agents were not concerned about this, and instead told the Onigashima agents of their orders. By command from those above, a fleet was sent to annex the island as territory of the World Government in the event of Kaidou's defeat, though both agents expressed their disbelief for such a thing to happen. Lucci then gave orders to the on-island agents, stating that no matter which side won, Nico Robin was to be captured, to which the agents quickly complied.

On the third floor, the battle between Killer and Hawkins came to a standstill, with the Massacre Soldier unable to harm the Magician, as well as preventing anyone else from doing so for fear of hurting Kid. Taking advantage of this, Hawkins banged his head against a pillar while transferring all damage to Kid, as Killer begged the straw man to release his captain's life, even offering his own life in return. Hawkins then kicked Killer to the ground and started stomping him, as he ranted on the futility of facing the Four Emperors. However, Killer saw through him, believing that the Magician actually regretted surrendering to Kaidou, seeing that the alliance faced impossible odds and came this far. At the same time, Killer realized the weakness of . He then chopped of Hawkins' left arm and extracted Kid's doll from it, which was only possible because the captain did not have a left arm. Hawkins then attacked, drawing the  from the , and having his giant straw puppet attack Killer, though the Massacre Soldier easily defeated it with . Hawkins attempted to recover his straw monster by drawing another card but ended up hesitating when he realized he drew the , which symbolized the collapse of the old with a hidden meaning of "a new path forward", which allowed Killer to finish him with .

As Nami, Usopp and Tama descended the stairs between the second and first floor with their tamed Headliner escorts, they come across Kin'emon's disembodied legs, desperately running around looking for comrades. As it turned out, after Law separated Kin'emon with his ability back in  Punk Hazard, his torso was never properly attached to his lower body, thus allowing him to survive when Kaidou impaled him. Taking advantage of this, he sent his legs out to find help. The Straw Hats caught the legs, and after indicating themselves as allies by drawing the mark of the rebellion, Kin'emon communicated with them (using farts) the dire condition he and Kiku were in. Using Hamlet as a ride, Usopp volunteered to go help them.

During the chaos, Orochi, who again survived his decapitation managed to sneak through the castle undetected, even witnessing Jack's defeat. He eventually made it to the Treasure Repository, where he barricaded himself inside with the Beasts Pirates riches. He then contacted the dying Kanjuro, directing him to use his ability to create  Kazenbo, a giant burning ghost that could pass through walls and with pre-programmed directions to head for the Armory so as to cause maximum damage to all sides. After ending his call, Orochi, believing himself to be safe inside the Treasure Repository, resolved himself to wait for Fukurokuju. However, as he waited, he heard a shamisen in the next room, and when he went to look, he found that, to his happy disbelief, it was none other than Komurasaki.

On the second floor, the battle against Big Mom was going badly as, thanks to Basil Hawkins, Kid gained a massive headache and was unable to fight properly. Law used  to get in close and land a  on Big Mom, however, he was soon struck down by Prometheus's . Linlin then used Hera and Napoleon to perform  on Kid. Though they both got back up again, Kid briefly lost his metal arm when Killer cut of Hawkins arm, which he later recreated. After Killer won against the Magician, all of Kid's ailments he received from Hawkins cleared up, allowing him to fight at full strength. The two pirates at some point strategized to make use of their awakened abilities, despite the severe drain to their stamina and the vulnerability afterwards if they do, seeing as they have no other way to bring her down. As the fight continued, they soon found themselves on the Performance Floor, with Kid being blasted back by Big Mom's . As Big Mom went after him, Law used his  awakened Devil Fruit ability, . This allowed him to coat his blade with a  that could pierce through a person without hurting them, before performing an operation from within them, which he promptly did to Linlin, with , causing the Emperor severe internal damage. Kid promptly followed up with his own awakened ability , which made Big Mom herself highly magnetic, and caused all the metal around her to fly at her at high velocity, burying the Emperor under a pile of steel beams. However, she soon got up and used  on the nearby Beasts Pirates, stealing their souls and using them to turn the steel beams into Homies. She then consumed a year of her own life to empower herself further before continuing the fight.

Drake managed to chase Apoo all the way to the Cave Chamber, where the Roar of the Sea is now backed up by the Numbers  Inbi,  Fuga, and  Zanki. Figuring out that Drake was most likely a Marine spy, Apoo offered him an alliance of his own, and proposed to sweep in and claim victory with the artificial  ancient giants once the fighting reaches its conclusion. However, Drake was not tempted and continued to fight, as he dodged Apoo's , and revealed he understood the secrets of the  Oto Oto no Mi. However, soon Yamato burst in and, though confused at what the Supernovas were doing there, even briefly clashing with Drake, after confirming that both sides were currently unaffiliated to the Beasts Pirates, he continued running to the armory, but now with Fuga following him. Apoo also followed him, persistently attempting to persuade him to his side, while Drake chased after him. However, when the group reached the basement's second level, Brook and the now conscious Robin fell from above, landing in Fuga's hair. Due to attempting to flee the flames as well as the CP0 agents who were seeking to capture Robin they leapt all the way from the second floor to the basement's second level. The agents jumped after the Straw Hats, however they ended up being smothered and burned by Kanjuro's Kazenbo. As the Kazenbo headed down, Yamato realized that it was headed for the Armory, and redoubled his efforts. Ironically, thanks to the Kazenbo, a wall of flames now separated Robin and Brook from the agents, with the Straw Hats using this opportunity to flee. Apoo foolishly decided to antagonize the agents by taking their pictures and declared that he would sell them to Morgans, which resulted him being struck down by Guernica's . When Drake confronted them, they revealed they knew who he worked for, before attempting to attack him as well. However, Guernica ended up receiving a  from Apoo, who had managed to survive the attack using Busoshoku Haki. With the agents eager to eliminate them, the two pirates reluctantly teamed up against the CP0.

In the Dome Interior of the Performance Floor, Sanji does his best to fend of Queen's , while the brachiosaurus-hybrid demanded the cook to use his Raid Suit, as he was curious about  Judge's technology. When Sanji refused, Queen fired a  from his tail, though the Black Leg dodged and landed a  on the Plague's belly, knocking him back. Queen then transformed into his full beast form, before launching only his head, neck and tail part at Sanji with , and then wrapping up the cook with  before he could react. Demanding he would only let Sanji go if he used the Raid Suit (which Sanji refused again), Queen in the end let loose his coils after he unintentionally had the  attached to his torso portion fire onto himself, twice. However, the freed Sanji soon got up, and though he had several broken bones, he was actually able to quickly fix them right before Queen slashed at Sanji with his massive blade. However, it was the blade that shattered, and Sanji soon came to realize, much to his horror, that he might be somehow awakening the modified superhuman abilities of his brothers'. Afraid he might turn into heartless people like his brothers', Sanji fled in order to buy time to organize his thoughts, though Queen continued to pursue him. As he ran away, some of the Beasts Pirates fired at his head, though instead of killing him, Sanji claimed it only hurt.

Sanji ran all the way to the Pleasure Hall in the Left Brain Tower, where he stumbled upon a geisha,  O-Some, who was looking for her  pet mouse,  Chuji. However, Queen, who was stalking Sanji using his stealth function and had a grudge against O-Some for rejecting his advances, snuck up on and attacked her. Before Sanji knew it, the girl was suddenly sent flying and started bleeding. Sanji left her with her fellow geishas, but they thought he was responsible. Due to the suddenness of the attack, Sanji thought that he had a lapse in memory when it occurred and feared that he might have had actually been the one responsible, believing that he had started turning into a heartless being like his brothers'. After Queen turned up, transforming from his beast form to his hybrid form, Sanji made a decision. Believing that the Raid Suit was the thing that altered his body by awakening his latent modifications, Sanji resolutely destroyed it, before calling Zoro. Fearing the worst, Sanji requested Zoro, (who was in the midst of combat) that if after the battle he wasn't himself, for the swordsman to kill him. After Zoro agreed to it, Sanji hung up, before suddenly disappearing in front of Queen's eyes, and attacking him with .

However, Queen soon got back up, claiming that Zoro wouldn't be able to win against King, as the Wildfire was a  Lunarian, the last of an otherwise extinct race who was considered by some as gods. When Sanji asked how they almost became extinct, Queen just told Sanji to ask "history" himself, before firing a laser at him. Queen suddenly used , which Sanji dodged; followed by  that landed on Sanji. As Queen barraged Sanji with  again, which the cook desperately avoided, the Plague boasted how he had already perfected  Germa technology and that he only wanted Sanji to wear the Raid Suit in order to prove his superiority over Judge.

He then grabbed Sanji with his extendable arm and used , however, the Black Leg managed to break Queen's extendable arm before using  to send Queen away. Sanji discerned that his kicks were actually doing damage to Queen, but the Plague then turned invisible using Sanji's Raid Suit ability, . Sanji disappeared in response, which Queen realized wasn't the ability of technology, but simply super high movement speed, though the cyborg believed that when Sanji reappeared, he would be exhausted. Just then, Chuji appeared in the seemingly empty battlefield, followed by O-Some, who was once again looking for the mouse. Queen, still petty about her rejections, approached her while invisible and planned to once again attack her, when an enraged Sanji, who now understood that it was the dinosaur-man who attacked O-Some earlier, struck first. By combining the Busoshoku Haki he trained with the power, speed and the exoskeleton of his newly modified body to the fullest, Sanji created a stronger form dubbed , which emitted not only flames, but lightning as well. Sanji chained a series of kicks, culminating in , which blew Queen off of Onigashima. After Sanji returned Chuji to O-Some, having collected the mouse during the fight and kept it safe in his jacket, he suddenly collapsed from exhaustion, surprising the girl who immediately called for medical help, which he later received.

In the Performance Floor, Zoro managed to cut a portion of King's mask, which enraged the Calamity, who entered his hybrid form and started to fire off indiscriminate cutting attacks, which hurt friend and foe alike to get at Zoro. His attacks were powerful enough to send Zoro flying into the Right Brain Tower, where Franky was, who managed to catch the swordsman. Franky offered to help, but the swordsman instead requested he stay away, which the cyborg easily agreed to. King then flew at Zoro at high-speed attacking with , which the Pirate Hunter attempted to counter with , and though the Wildfire pushed back Zoro in this clash, his mask was further damaged by the swordsman. Zoro then realized that he was being pushed of the island, so he used the recoil from  to push himself back on the island. As the battle continued outside the Skull Dome, Zoro received the call from Sanji, and though he accepted the request, he told the cook to come back alive.

King then took some distance, and using a bizarre natural technique of the pteranodon, launched a  at Zoro who barely evaded it. The Pirate Hunter then attempted to ground King with , but the Wildfire managed to defend against it. King then obliged Zoro by engaging him in a swordfight, though as they fought, the Pirate Hunter desperately tried to figure out King's secrets in order to defeat him, even as he was being knocked back. Suddenly, Zoro heard Hiyori's shamisen, which triggered Enma to start sucking out his Haki. Zoro forcefully stopped the sword, when King suddenly came up right before the swordsman in his human form in a defenseless position. Not knowing what King was thinking, Zoro stabbed at him, which resulted in a massive explosion on contact, with King coming out of it unscathed. Zoro managed to defend against it with Haki, before striking back with , though the attack appeared to do nothing to King. Zoro attempted to switch back to Three Sword Style as King prepared another  in his beast form, but just as he drew Enma, the sword once again started to suck out its wielders Haki, causing the swordsman to lose focus and allowing his opponent's attack to graze him. This caused Zoro to lose his swords, and as he recovered them one-by-one he recalled details about each of them.

However, King did not plan to let up, delivering a burning kick at Zoro just as he retrieved the  Sandai Kitetsu, then transforming into his hybrid form to send a  from above, just as the swordsman collected the Wado Ichimonji and was retrieving Enma. The attack ended up sending him into the basement, and actually gave Zoro time to connect the clues of his own weapon. He realized that the certain old man in his village, who was  Kuina's grandfather and who taught him Sunacchi, was none other than Shimotsuki Kozaburo, who illegally left Wano, became a pirate and later established Zoro's hometown, Shimotsuki Village. He was also the blacksmith who forged Wado Ichimonji and Enma. Recalling the words of the blacksmith, Zoro realized that Enma was testing him and that he had to go all out with his Haki, even going so far as to release his Haoshoku Haki. When King inquired about if he intended to be a king, Zoro agreed as he recalled his promise to Luffy and Kuina to become the world's greatest swordsman.

Zoro managed to land another hit and damaged more of King's mask, having realized a secret of King's physiology; the presence of flames on his back indicated a decrease in speed but a boost in defense, whilst the absence implied the opposite. King then tore the rest of the mask off, when some of his conscious subordinates recognized his traits and mentioned that the World Government had offered 100,000,000 for any information on lunarians, which caused the All-Star to burn them with . Zoro then invited King to continue their fight outside, with the Wildfire accepting, launching a  which the Pirate Hunter managed to deflect. Zoro then demonstrated his new  En-Ō Santōryū: Rengoku Oni Giri, which King dodged while recalling how he first met Kaidou while they were both held prisoner on Punk Hazard as test subjects, where Kaidou freed him and gave him the name King. In the present, King immediately responded with a , which Zoro in turn dodged. King then attempted to again use his swordbreaker mechanism, but Zoro managed to emit Haki in order to push his opponent away before he could be disarmed. The All-Star then snuffed out his back flames to plant a high-speed kick on Zoro, though the swordsman instantly responded by successfully landing a  in return. As both combatants have reached their limits, King launched his , but Zoro's  not only sliced the fire dragon in half, but hit King as well, slicing off his right wing and sending the Wildfire falling off of Onigashima. As King fell, he regretfully recalled his oath to Kaidou to make him the King of Pirates. Zoro simultaneously recalled his own oath to Luffy as he resolved himself to become the King of Hell, before using  to propel himself back on Onigashima and collapsing shortly after.

In the crawlspace between the 1st and 2nd floor, Usopp desperately defended Kin'emon and Kiku, from a continuous stream of Beasts Pirates. While the two prone samurai insisted that he either save the other one and get out of there, or to save himself, Usopp vehemently declined and scolded them on how he hated the samurai pride and self-sacrificial ways. Just as he was about to be overwhelmed, Izou appeared and held back the enemies for them, allowing Usopp and Hamlet to take the incapacitated samurai away. The information of the Calamities' defeats soon reached Joseph in the Guests Parlor, who in turn informed the other two agents, just as they defeated Zanki and Drake, though Apoo and Inbi managed to get away. Joseph ordered them to quickly kidnap Robin since, on the off chance the Worst Generation succeeded, the repercussions would be immense, though all the CP0 agents seemed to think it was unlikely as they could not imagine the Emperors losing. They soon encountered a heavily injured Izou, who had just succeeded in defeating the Beasts Pirates in the crawlspace and had just descended to the first basement floor. The agents who opted to let him go in order to fulfill their own mission, yet the former Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates decide to stand in their way.

In  Mary Geoise, the  Five Elders briefly complained about the most recent Levely, before turning their attention to Wano. Due to the unexpected intensity of the battles, they fully believed that they could get away with kidnapping Robin and that the CP0 had already secured her. Their conversation then shifted to their fears of a certain Devil Fruit "awakening," one whose identity even they were unaware of; the original name of which the World Government changed centuries ago, in order to erase its existence from history. Meanwhile, in the seas around Wano, a lookout of the Wano occupation fleet noticed the giant silhouette of  Zunesha but mistook it for an island.

On the performance floor, Law and Kid's battle against Big Mom continued though it proved to be going badly for the Supernovas. Having knocked them down she continued to attack them, eliciting pleas for her to stop from their respective crews. They then attempted to retrieve their captains, which provoked Big Mom to use  on them, before attempting to fly back to the roof to assist Kaidou. However, Law used his awakened ability  to inflict more damage on her which caused the I-beam homies to target him. Thankfully Kid used his own abilities to incorporate the homies into , and charged the bull construct into her smashing her against a wall. Both captains then stated their resolve to die before letting her go to the roof, before starting to bicker amongst themselves.

Big Mom soon got up and used her ability to fix her broken arm, before attacking the magnetic construct with , slicing it in half. Kid then used his awakened ability  to pin Linlin to a tower before again attempting to crush her with the bull construct, though Big Mom instead breaks the tower, swings it around and uses it to block the attack. Big Mom then uses  to turn the energy of the  into a giant homie  Misery and had it indiscriminately attacked her enemies. However, Law used  to drop a tower on her, giving him an opportunity to stab her with , this time lengthening  Kikoku to the point it pierced straight through Onigashima and deep into the Wano mainland. Though she tried to stop Law with haki-enhanced punches, Law endured it and used , which created a massive hole through the island as well as a giant pit on the mainland. Kid then appeared above Big Mom and fired , a huge railgun construct, at her, which pushed her into the hole.

Yet the Emperor endured this, grabbing the edges of the hole and used  in an attempt to steal the souls of those around her and use them to empower herself. In response to this, Law used the awakened ability , to nullify all noises she produced and cancel the effect of  on their nearby crewmates, after which he vertically bisected Misery who was attempting to save Big Mom. Kid in turn fired an even stronger blast of , which pushed Linlin through the hole. As she fell through Onigashima and into the pit created by Law's earlier attack, she thought of Roger and the One Piece, while also swearing revenge on Law and Kid and after she stated that she would not die from this, experienced a massive explosion that no one could hear due to the effects of Law's abilities. The two pirates then collapsed from exhaustion while their crew celebrated. Noticing the damage to the roof occurring from the fight between Kaidou and Luffy, Kid questioned whether Law would be able to battle the other Emperor afterwards, which the Surgeon of Death denied, claiming that if the King of the Beasts won, he wouldn't have the strength to resist him.

On the second floor, Jinbe was seen catching and supporting the burning ceiling before it collapsed on some of his samurai allies. In the Performance Floor, Chopper finally recovered from the side effects of his newly modified Rumble Ball, and instantly started worrying about Zoro, who he knew should be suffering from twice the damage he received prior to taking the Mink's super-recovery medicine. When the explosion in the armory occurred, he and his allies were all caught off balance and ended up stumbling. The same applied to Robin and Brook who were fleeing from the flames. As for the Pirate Hunter himself, he had gained consciousness, but was immobile due to drugs side effect and seeing what seemed looked like the grim reaper standing above him, getting ready to reap his life. He was later seen on the very edge of Onigashima, bloodied and unconscious, when the bomb in the armory was set off and caused the rocks which he was lying on to collapse and for him to fall with them. Fortunately, Franky, who had run all the way through the Right Brain Tower looking for the swordsman, managed to catch Zoro with , just as he fell over. Usopp had managed to reach the castle's basement with Kin'emon and Kiku while riding on Hamlet's back. Nami took shelter with Tama, Marco, Speed, and the unconscious Komachiyo and Hihimaru in the Forehead floor baths, while not sparing any sympathy for Zeus who was weeping over Big Mom.

On the third floor, Raizo and Fukurokuju's fight had come to a stalemate. Despite being surrounded by flames, both sides had each other under , with the two enemies demanding the other to undo the paralysis technique first. Though the flames reached Raizo first, he stubbornly refused to release the technique. The two ninja's both endured the flames, though Fukurokuju handled the heat worse, instantly proclaiming his pain shortly after catching fire, while Raizo didn't even flinch despite being completely engulfed. When the castle abruptly shook due to the explosion caused by the battle between Linlin and the Law-Kid combo, Fukurokuju tumbled over while engulfed in flames and screaming for water, whilst Raizo remained standing, thus earning his victory. With his opponent burnt up and unconscious, Raizo started rolling around in an attempt to put out the flames, when Jinbe found him. Recognizing an ally, Raizo bemoaned to himself of how "preparations" for something were almost complete.

In the second floor Treasure Repository, Orochi wondered whether "Komurasaki" being alive was some kind of dream and asked her to play her famous song, to which Hiyori agreed. When the explosion occurred at the finale of the battle against Big Mom, both were surprised as Orochi also toppled over. Now anxious, and wondering about what happened to Fukurokuju, and whether the ninja betrayed him, he became quickly irritated when "Komurasaki" continued to calmly play the shamisen. He then started scolding her for continuing to play in such a life-or-death situation and criticized her wearing the mask when she did, even questioning whether she was alive or a ghost. He was so engrossed in screaming at her that he noticed too late when the ceiling collapsed on him, and his inability to transform. With Orochi now helpless, Hiyori calmly revealed several things to the shogun, such as how she secretly used Seastone nails on him to nullify his Devil Fruit ability, how she never loved him, and how she is the daughter of Kozuki Oden.

In the basement area, Kazenbo continued to phase through floors, gradually getting closer to the armory. When Yamato noticed  Rokki sleeping while guarding the door to the armory, he ordered Fuga to charge straight through Rokki and the door, allowing him to enter, while Fuga also pinned down Rokki. He finally reached the armory, and seeing Kazenbo just moments away from making contacts with some bombs, he used  to freeze the explosives, before striking the sentient painting with  when it attempted to melt through his ice. Kazenbo then directed its flames at him, which Yamato endured. When Law pierced through the island with , Yamato was shocked to see the hole appear through the armory, and even more so when Big Mom fell through said hole, completely silently. As Linlin plummeted, in a bid to stop her fall, she inadvertently grabbed one of the massive bombs and set it off, with the resulting explosion not only briefly stunning her, and blowing off a massive chunk of Onigashima's base, but also caused the majority of Kazenbo to dissipate, except for a small sentient wisp, that escaped to report to Orochi of its failure. Thankfully, Yamato used his freezing abilities to prevent the other bombs from being set off. With the armory now open to the air, Yamato started talking to Momonosuke who was still attempting to tow the island in the opposite direction of the Flower Capital using Kaidou's Flame Clouds. He then revealed that Zunesha was close by, having heard it using the Voice of all Things, revealing that the giant elephant is willing to fight on their side. Though Yamato is amazed, Momonosuke goes on to state his doubts. Having read his father's journal, Momonosuke understood why he must continue surviving, but as Oden has torn out the most important part from the journal, he couldn't understand why his predecessor wanted to open Wano's borders, and whether he would still want to if he could see Wano now. Seeing only danger for his people if he opened the borders and unwilling to put his citizens through such things, he openly stated that he did not wish to follow his father's will, before asking Yamato if he thought he was a coward.

In the castle basement, Izou's battle concluded with a double knockout against  Maha, with Guernica heavily injured. Though frustrated at this development, Guernica still planned to continue the mission to capture Robin, when he received a call from the Joseph. He conveyed a new order from the Five Elders, to assassinate Luffy, much to Guernica's shock, who claimed that it would be impossible for him to intrude in Luffy and Kaidou's duel. Joseph agreed, stating that the order was to prevent the worst-case scenario. As the two agents talked, X Drake had recovered enough, and approached the Guernica from behind, resolving not to die without showing some kind of results. Drake then stabbed Guernica in the back with his sword, which elicited him to ask the undercover Marine, why. The Red Flag responded by claiming that this was his justice, to which the agent claimed he was jealous, before freeing himself with  and felling Drake with a  just below his throat.

Atop the Skull Dome, the battle between Luffy and Kaidou continued, as the former stubbornly attempted to land a blow on the latter despite the Emperor, now in his hybrid form, knocking him back. Luffy finally managed to land a , even though Kaidou managed to land a blow on him first. Both pirates collapsed, but soon rose again while laughing, with each of them expressing how they were having fun. Kaidou reverted back to his human form and started to chug some alcohol, and when Luffy expressed his annoyance, believing that doing so would weaken the Emperor, Kaidou stated the alcohol would make him stronger and demonstrated his , where his drunken mood swings dramatically improved his combat abilities. Afterwards, Luffy's  clashed with Kaidou's , with both pirates landing blows on each other, though Luffy broke the stalemate with a kick to Kaidou's gut. When Big Mom was defeated, the two pirates were in the midst of a clash of haki-infused attacks, with Luffy being pushed back. Sensing that Linlin lost her battle, Kaidou emitted his Haoshoku Haki in rage, though Luffy expressed how impressed he was that Law and Kid managed to win. Kaidou then recalled how the two first met, before entering his  mode and bursting into tears, though Luffy responded by entering , and barraging Kaidou with , stating that Kaidou's ambition meant nothing to him, how this was his final , and how he wasn't stopping till he drove the King of the Beasts out of Wano.

Kaidou is seemingly unable to respond to the omni-directional  attack, and contemplates how such an attack should be impossible due to the innate nature of rubber, as he slowly transitions to his  mode. Kaidou manages to escape the attack, using  and advanced Kenbunshoku, before transforming into his full beast form, grabbing Luffy in his mouth and flying high into the sky. He then let go of Luffy before firing a point-blank  straight down, which blasted the Straw Hat captain all the way through Onigashima. Thankfully, Luffy managed to only escape the attack by transitioning into his  form and flying back to the top of the island. He then got above Kaidou and landed a  on the Emperor, which disrupted the  the dragon was preparing to fire. However, Kaidou quickly recovered, entering his hybrid form and using  mode to floor Luffy with . With Luffy resolving to end this with one final hit, he quickly bounced back and charged at the Emperor with another , with Kaidou dashing at him whilst preparing another . However, Guernica suddenly appeared and locked Luffy's attacking arm by grabbing on to it and using , allowing Kaidou to knock the Straw Hat captain down. The agent escaped the strike, releasing just before the Emperor hit, whilst Kaidou could only attack in despair, as he relived another exciting battle being sabotaged by outside influence, just like during his duel against Oden.

With the final strike, Luffy was defeated with his heart stopping and body deflating, his "presence" disappearing, which was noted not only by those present, but by Momonosuke and Joseph below. Kaidou then faced Guernica, who accepted his fate as Kaidou struck him down, before descending into the Skull Dome. There, he announced his victory whilst declaring Luffy dead and demanding to know where Momonosuke was, raising the morale of the Beasts Pirates, while the alliance's forces were full of disbelief, except for Law and Kid who also couldn't sense the Straw Hat captain. When Nami denied Kaidou's statement, he fired a  at her, which Marco managed to block. Declaring how he planned to enslave Wano's entire populace, which brought further despair to the alliance members, Kaidou again demanded for Momonosuke's head. The revitalized Beasts Pirates then aimed for Law and Kid, though their crew members came to their rescue, with both captains resolving to continue fighting despite their exhaustion.

In the 2nd Floor Treasure Repository, the trapped Orochi started pleading for his life, claiming how he always admired Oden and that everything was Kaidou's fault, however Hiyori didn't believe a word he said. She stated how her father always kept his words, comparing him to Orochi who never did, before taking of her mask to reveal her angry, tear-ridden face as she declared her pride as a Kozuki. Orochi continued to beg for his life, until a wisp of Kazenbo appeared to report to the shogun. Believing the tides have turned, he ordered the flame to burn Hiyori, however the weakened wisp could only reach Orochi, setting him alight, whilst Hiyori declared that "the dawn will come."

Outside of Onigashima, Momonosuke and Yamato argued fiercely, as Momonosuke contemplated surrendering. However, Yamato earnestly believed that fighting to their last breath would be preferable, as giving in would mean slavery, and thus no one would be saved. At this point Zunesha started talking to Momonosuke, claiming it could hear the "Drums of Liberation" which signified the awakening of Joy Boy. This statement shocked the pink dragon, who realized that the "voice" that Zunesha could hear was none other than Luffy's, which lead him to realize that Luffy was also Joy Boy.

Meanwhile, back in Mary Geoise, one of the Five Elders questioned whether it was really necessary to anger Kaidou while sacrificing an agent, just to sabotage Luffy. However, the others commented that it was necessary to prevent Luffy's Devil Fruit from awakening, revealing that, what was thought to be the  Paramecia-type Gomu Gomu no Mi, is actually the  Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit, Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, a fruit named after a god. They also commented how the World Government had been attempting to secure the fruit for over 800 years, but it has always escaped their grasp, even believing that it was by the will of the Zoan fruit itself had been evading them. The Elders went on to explain that awakening reveals the true power of the Devil Fruit, and how it grants the user greater physical strength as well as freedom to their fighting style, which is only limited by their imagination, claiming that there is no power in the world more ridiculous.

Atop the Skull Dome, Luffy started twitching, as his heart slowly started to beat again, picking up speed until it started to beat to a certain rhythm, which in turn lead to him transforming. Luffy soon entered a new form, and started laughing and jumping around, and whilst still confused at how he survived, he commented to himself how he felt full of power, and instinctually believed that he could do anything, declaring his new power as  Gear 5.

Luffy's awakening was noticed by others besides Momonosuke, including Sanji, Kid, Law, Hyogoro and Marco, who notified the nearby Nami and Tama about Luffy's survival. When Luffy reached a spot directly above Kaidou, he released a blast of Haoshoku Haki which knocked out a good number of Beasts Pirates, before reaching down with an inflated fist, grabbing Kaidou and then comically pulling him back up. He then inflated his other arm and started swinging Kaidou's around before repeatedly slamming the dragon's head into the ground. Kaidou quickly recovered from his dizziness, thanking Luffy for surviving before releasing a  at him. Though Luffy acted comically shocked, he reacted quickly to the attack, stretching the ground beneath him and bouncing the breath back. Kaidou endured the counterattack, and then apologized for their sabotaged battle, though Luffy didn't take it to heart, instead requesting to finish this battle.

As Kaidou observed Luffy bouncing around on the rubbery ground, the Emperor thought that Luffy awakened his Devil Fruit abilities, but was confused as his physical transformation was more akin to a Zoan-type awakening than a Paramecia-type. He then swallowed Luffy whole in his dragon form, but Luffy started bouncing around in his stomach, before expanding with , which inflated Kaidou as well and caused them both to float like a helium balloon. Luffy soon escaped from Kaidou's stomach, by using  to stretch his arms through Kaidou's eyes, grabbing onto his snout and propelling himself out through the dragon's mouth. As Luffy deflated his balloon, he ended up in the thunder clouds, but as he descended, he used  to become a literal giant. Kaidou then bit onto Luffy, but the Straw Hat pirate in turn grabbed onto Kaidou's head and tail and used  to use the dragon as a literal jumping rope. Kaidou then repelled his opponent with , which blasted the giant man away, however Luffy quickly shook off the charring and literally ran on air while creating a burning trail in midair to get back to the Skull Dome. Kaidou, now back in his hybrid form, smashed the charging Luffy's head straight through the Skull Dome with . After Luffy squeezed his head back through the hole, he deflated from his giant form, while Kaidou commented how everything Luffy does is something out of a comic, before declaring that the Straw Hat could not defeat him. Luffy tried to remain defiant, but the transformation wore off, causing the rubber man to experience a severe amount of exhaustion, fatigue and aging simultaneously. Kaidou too, expressed his exhaustion by taking a knee, and when Luffy admitted how close to death he felt, the Emperor suggested the young pirate to accept his fate. However, Luffy refused while reentering his awakened form, claiming that he didn't fear death and declaring that they were not done as he remembered those who believed him, which included Momonosuke, Tama, Kin'emon and Pedro. Kaidou accepted his decision, and struck at Luffy, but the sun god comically warped around the Hassaikai. Kaidou then struck again with Luffy warping and absorbing the hit with both his body and rubbery ground, before bouncing away. The Straw Hat pirate then sprung back at Kaidou with a Haki-infused punch that stretched straight through the Emperor's head.

As Luffy bounced around trying to think of a name for his new attack, Kaidou asked the Straw Hat captain who he was, which the sun god in turn affirmed that he was Monkey D. Luffy, the future Pirate King. Kaidou then explained about the Devil Fruit's awakening, before commenting about everything he lost in this war, though Luffy in turn stated that he was going to take everything that Kaidou had taken back. The Emperor responded by attacking with , with Luffy taking all the hits, before responding with a barrage of punches of his own which warped Kaidou's body as well. Luffy then noticed the smoke from the flames below, with Kaidou mentioning how Luffy's allies would all be burnt to death within his burning castle, the Straw Hat captain simply stated that he could leave everything to his crew so all he had to do was concentrate on defeating his opponent. In response Kaidou released a  which Luffy dodged.

Within the castle, the fire had grown to the point that many of the combatants were more focused on escaping or putting out the blaze rather than fighting each other. At this time, Chopper had reunited with Nami in the Performance Floor; Robin and Brook were surrounded by flames in the Basement; Usopp was elsewhere in the Basement with Hamlet and the two immobilized Red Scabbards, using  in a futile attempt to put out the flames; Sanji escorted the oiran's in the Left Brain Tower, looking for a safer place; while Franky ran through the Right Brain Tower with some tamed Gifters, looking for Chopper in order to save Zoro. Furthermore, the Heart Pirates were also attempting to escape the flames on the First Floor; some of the Minks were trapped on the Third Floor; with some of the Kid Pirates carrying an immobile Killer descending from the First Floor; while Apoo was seen scolding Inbi in the basement, after the artificial ancient giant failed to break through the wall they were attempting to escape through, due to the intense heat.

Throughout all this chaos, Jinbe and Raizo prepared to carry out a plan to save everyone. As it turned out, during Raizo's stay at Zou, the ninja used his  Maki Maki no Mi abilities to store an immense amount of water from Zunesha's eruption rain. He did this in hopes of never allowing what happened to Kuri Castle twenty years ago to ever happen again. On the Fourth Floor, Raizo used  to unleash the eruption rain at Jinbe, who took control of the deluge and spread it around the castle with , putting out as much of the fire as possible.

Elsewhere in the castle, the combatants have come to the conclusion that the shaking meant the island was soon going to fall. However, after Hyogoro stated that Luffy's victory may mean their death, while Kaidou's triumph would only slightly extend their lives, and questioned his allies of their preference, the samurai made their peace and cheered for Luffy, for the sake of their loved ones on the mainland. In the Treasure Repository, the shaking managed to dislodge the Seastone nail from the burning Orochi, who then transformed with the intent of taking Hiyori down with him. A flashback is then shown of various things that Orochi did to Wano after Oden's execution: how Orochi directed the troops to Kuri as the Nine Scabbards fled, with Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates attacking and killing everyone in Kuri castle before setting it ablaze; how the other daimyo and their troops fell to Kaidou while Orochi laughed in the backline; how Orochi enslaved every able-bodied man, built weapon factories and polluted the land, making it impossible to farm, all to make more weapons for Kaidou; and how Orochi laughed gleefully as the starving citizens of Ebisu Town who became Pleasures after eating the failed SMILE fruits. Back in the present, just as Orochi was about to attack Hiyori, Denjiro appeared and decapitated the shogun, while embracing Hiyori who cried into his chest.

As Luffy and Kaidou's battle continued, Luffy grabbed a lightning bolt and threw it at Kaidou, with , but the Emperor dodged before striking the Straw Hat captain back. Luffy grabbed onto another lightning bolt and used it to bounce back at Kaidou with a flying kick, but the King of the Beasts struck his opponent into the ground, with the sun god turning the surface into rubber to cushion the blow. However, he ended up bouncing back straight into Kaidou's , which sent him flying into the clouds. As they were fighting Kaidou commented how a powerful ability is not enough, with Roger proving this, as Haki was the one true power to conquer the seas. Despite being sent into the clouds, Luffy grabbed onto Kaidou's chest and held on, though this gave away his position, allowing the fully transformed dragon to counterattack with  and . However, Luffy did not defend himself, and instead called out to Momonosuke to move the island, as the sun god brought down a Haki-infused fist the size of Onigashima down on Kaidou.

Kaidou encased himself in an avatar resembling a larger version of his dragon form, composed of flames hot enough to melt rocks, confident that Luffy would melt to nothing before the attack hit, though Luffy stated that he would never make contact with the technique as his own attack used emissive Haki. With that, Luffy brought down his  which Kaidou faced head on with . As the two clashed, a flashback revealed Kaidou's past: how at 10 he became his homeland's strongest soldier; how at thirteen he started questioning the Celestial Dragons, and how his king attempted to forcibly trade Kaidou to the Marines for the right to attend the Levely; how he frequently escaped and was caught by the Marines, which earned him a starting bounty of 70,000,000; how he became renown of Hachinosu at fifteen and soon recruited by Rocks, with the Rocks Pirates ending up being defeated by Garp and Roger when he was twenty-one; how at thirty-one he was approached by Kurozumi Higurashi to assist Orochi in taking over Wano; and how, after Yamato mentioned it, Kaidou talked to King about Joy Boy being the one who will defeat him, to which King replied that would never happen. In the present, as the two attacks clashed, Kaidou questioned what kind of world that the Straw Hat captain planned to create, to which Luffy replied that it would be one where his friends would never go hungry. With that resolve, Luffy's fist broke through Kaidou's technique, punching him deep into the ground.

Meanwhile, as Luffy and Kaidou fought outside, Yamato begged Momonosuke to create , as the island was soon going to fall. As the pink dragon desperately attempted to make the , he banished his pessimism and resolved himself to do so after he recalled his last moments with his mother, as he begged her and Hiyori to go with him into the future, but was eventually convinced to go to the future by Kin'emon's heartfelt plea. When Luffy called out to him the move the island, Momonosuke was shocked to see an island-sized fist coming down from the sky. As the water of Zou that Raizo and Jinbe used to put out the flames suddenly flooded out, it doused the flame clouds prematurely, causing the island to plummet. This gave Momonosuke just the boost he needed to create a large amount of flame clouds, which he wrapped around the island and quickly towed out of the way of the clash of attacks between the two pirates, just as Luffy overpowered Kaidou and smashed him into the ground where Onigashima just was. Momonosuke then gently landed Onigashima on the ground before he himself collapsed in exhaustion.

Luffy, now victorious, immediately fell unconscious, leaving Yamato to catch him as he fell from the sky. Inside Onigashima, Nekomamushi, who witnessed the end of Luffy's battle, announced how Momonosuke saved Onigashima, as well as Kaidou's loss, and declared the alliance's victory. Though some disbelieving Beasts Pirates still attempted to continue the battle, Yamato talked them out of it, claiming he would personally take them down if they didn't yield. As the alliance celebrated their victory, Chopper suddenly gained an influx of patients, with Usopp arriving with Kin'emon and Kiku, and Franky with Zoro, though thankfully Miyagi and Tristan came to assist him. Outside, Momonosuke talked to Zunesha, declaring that he would not open the country's boundaries yet, with the elephant respecting his decision. Meanwhile, in the capital, the Festival was reaching its end, with the partygoers watching the sky-boats with their wishes written on them float away. Hitetsu, who accompanied Toko to the Festival, recalled how just as she finished writing the wish on her own boat, she inquired about her father's death. Hitetsu had explained why he sacrificed himself, which led to Toko changing her wish from "I want to see Daddy" to "Daddy, Thank You", which the blacksmith happily yet tearfully approved of. All of a sudden, throughout the island, everyone felt a tremor. Due to both the Emperors being hammered straight through the earth and into the magma chamber below the island, this caused a reaction which ushered an underwater volcanic eruption of the coast of Udon. This led to the citizens to finally notice Onigashima just outside the Flower Capital, causing them to wonder what Kaidou was up to now.

At this point, Momonosuke flew in with Hiyori, Shinobu and the Red Scabbards announcing that the eruption was a signal of the end of Kaidou, though upon seeing him, the citizens started to flee, believing he was actually the Emperor. Declaring he wasn't the pirate, Momonosuke descended in front of the castle and transformed back into a human with a poof of smoke. "Komurasaki" and "Kyoshiro" then appeared from the smoke with the citizens instantly recognizing them. As the other Scabbards appeared, the citizens realized something big was happening and used a  Picture Tanishi to broadcast the event all over Wano. Momonosuke then made his appearance and declared the threat of Kaidou and Orochi were finally over, that Wano was finally free and that he would abolish the factories and restore the country, before declaring himself Shogun, eliciting tears of joy from the populace, his subordinates and his sister.

Meanwhile, inside Onigashima, Yamato introduced himself to the Straw Hat's as Kaidou's son, prompting aggressive reactions from them. He then reintroduced himself as Kozuki Oden and Yamato, before mentioning that he might be joining their crew, which drew out a variety of reactions from the Straw Hat's (with the exception of Chopper who was treating the unconscious Zoro and Luffy), though Jinbe stated that they wouldn't be convinced without their captain's confirmation. Yamato, alongside some tamed Gifters, then corralled some prisoners who attempted to escape, which elicited Usopp to question Tama about the effectiveness of her Devil Fruit power. Tama then explained that her ability only lasts a month, after which, the tamed animal would either revert back to normal, or remained tamed, depending on what the animal chooses. To this, the nearby Speed responded that she would be glad to stay by the girl's side even after the effect fades, which Tama herself approved of, though not as a servant, but as a mother. The Picture Tanishi then displayed Momonosuke's speech, which caused Tama to have flashbacks to when her parents died in the factory; how she made a living trying to sell straw hats; and how she met Hitetsu, who gave her hope that the Kozuki clan would return and restore the country. Recalling all this caused Tama to breakdown and cry into Nami's chest, as she also remembered Luffy's promise to allow her to eat as much as she wanted every day.

Elsewhere within Onigashima, Basil Hawkins dragged himself to X Drake and inquired if he was from the Marines, with the Red Flag refusing to answer. Drake in turn asked the Magician about his fortune telling, which stated that he would be fine if he didn't betray Kaidou, to which Hawkins replied that since he didn't stand besides Kid and Killer when they confronted the Emperor, and instead gave in, that he had no right to ally himself with them again even he foresaw the outcome of the raid. Drake then recalled that Hawkins predicted a certain man would have only 1% chance to survive till tomorrow just as the raid began, and when he asked about it, the Magician confirmed he was referring to himself.

In Mary Geoise, the Five Elders now stress over the multiple crisis they have to control, including the revival of Nika, the fall of two of the Four Emperor's, and the aftermath of the Revolutionary Army's attack. They inquire about Zou's disappearance after the battle and having learnt that Wano is still not opening its borders, they complement the shrewd one who made the decision, as they now have no way to send a major force to occupy the nation. They then ordered Guernica to continue his mission to kidnap Robin, but just as he complied, the transmission signal was intercepted, with someone demanding the CP0 to not move. Sometime later, they seemed to have encountered Big Mom's ship, before losing all communication, but not before Guernica sent out a picture of Luffy in his  form. A week later, the Five Elders directly contacted the Marines who published the bounties, scolding them for including the picture of the awakened Luffy, as well for not excluding the D. in his name, and demanding they stop the press and reprint the posters, but it was too late, with Morgans releasing the posters anyway.

A week after the raid, Wano, and the warriors who fought in the battle were close to recovering. With Orochi and Kaidou gone, several changes were made, including the education, which now told the truth about Oden and his retainers: and the food situation, with food and clean water now being available to everyone. Several rumors were also being spread, such as Hiyori's story with Kawamatsu and Denjiro, and because of Luffy's request to hide identity, as he didn't want to be regarded as a hero, the people of Wano now call him "Joy Boy" and Momonosuke claimed he already left the country as everyone praised him for defeating Kaidou. In Ringo, Kin'emon proposed building a temple to enshrine Oden, as well as the Daimyo's who fought for him, and included his two retainers that died in the battle, Ashura and Izou, which earned Kawamatsu and Marco's approval. At Tokage Port in Udon, the Thousand Sunny, Victoria Punk and the Polar Tang, as well as the General Franky were all nearly fully repaired, with their respective pirate crew relaxing close by (though only Franky and Usopp were working on the Sunny).

Law and Kid both warned their crew against unwinding, stating that the news of their exploits will almost definitely spread out and that they should be on their guards. Apoo then appeared with Inbi, revealing he leaked information about the raid, before giving them a newspaper that detailed their status. The paper disclosed that all three pirate captains gained a 3,000,000,000 bounty, while Luffy and Buggy were crowned the new Emperors. This prompted Kid to head to the Flower Capital to pick a fight with Luffy, with the other pirates going after him to join the festivities.

Elsewhere, Sakazuki called Aramaki a.k.a. Ryokugyu, demanding to know where he was, to which the Admiral casually confirmed that he was flying towards Wano, to which the  Fleet Admiral then demanded that Admiral to not make things worse, which Aramaki nonchalantly agreed to. Later, Sakazuki was in a meeting with  Kizaru and the Director of the Marine  Bureau of Investigation,  Tensei, discussing about the Revolutionary Army and their attack on Mary Geoise. They revealed how they declared war by destroying the symbol of the World Nobles, the Hoof of the Celestial Dragons, before facing the Marine Admirals Fujitora and Ryokugyu, before retreating with their ally,  Bartholomew Kuma who was successfully rescued from his enslavement, and Sabo allegedly murdering Nefertari Cobra afterwards. During the commotion,  Vivi went missing and someone attempted to murder  Charlos, with  Mjosgard supposedly covering for the attacker. These incidents earned Sabo the title of Flame Emperor, and caused an upsurge of revolutions worldwide, with eight nations simultaneously rebelling while their kings were still on their way home.

In the castle, Luffy and Zoro finally awakened, much to the joy of their crew and friends, and demanded meat and booze respectively. Yamato also partook in their meal, having deprived herself of food and baths as he performed a Wano-style vigil, praying for their recovery. Momonosuke also joined the Straw Hats and informed them that he was going to have the whole country participate in a banquet to celebrate their recovery, though his presence was initially met with confusion from the two formerly comatose Straw Hats. Zoro noticed that he and Luffy weren't dirty which elicited Hiyori to reveal that she was the one who cleaned him regularly, causing Sanji to get jealous and pick a fight with the swordsman. However, this in turn made Zoro remember their promise when Sanji called the swordsman during their duels with the All-Stars, prompting an all-out fight with Sanji, who belatedly stated that he didn't need Zoro to kill him anymore. The Straw Hats then entered the baths together with their friends (with Yamato joining the men's bath). In the evening the castle provided a gourmet banquet for them, however everyone except Jinbe couldn't bother waiting two hours for the carefully prepared food, and instead joined the festivities in the city. Luffy then lead everyone in Ninja-Mink-Pirate-Samurai Alliance into a cheer, dragging Kid who ran in to pick a fight to toast together with him. Immediately after the toast, Kid pushed Luffy away and revealed his intentions, showing his rival the news of his bounty and position as an Emperor, much to the Straw Hats surprise.

In the castle, Robin has slipped away from the party, and found a secret room with swords, kokeshi dolls and a wall covered in Poneglyph text. Tenguyama Hitetsu then approached her, revealing that he was the one who made those items, having once been imprisoned in the cell and that he was in fact Kozuki Sukiyaki. He explained that by the time he escaped, Oden was already dead, and the country had changed immensely, and that he had no intention of revealing himself to Momonosuke due to the shame of his failures. Robin then interrupted him as he was going to continue his story, inquiring whether, as the Poneglyph in  Arabasta Kingdom stated, the Ancient Weapon  Pluton was on the island, to which he affirmed. The two were later joined by Law who noticed they were missing and the three descended a series of stairs hidden in his secret room to reach the Road Poneglyph and Pluton. As they descended Sukiyaki allowed them to look through a crawl space, where much to their surprise, they found a whole city on the sea floor. Sukiyaki then explained that 800 years ago, Wano was originally a larger island at sea level, with one massive double summit volcano, known as Mount Fuji. However, a massive wall was built around the island for unknown reasons, with rainwater filling eventually all the way to the top of the walls, before overflowing. Land was established around the larger peak to form the current Wano, while the smaller peak became Onigashima. The trio then reached the bottom, in an underwater cavern, where Sukiyaki revealed the Road Poneglyph and claimed that Pluton was further ahead, though he never saw it himself. He then explained that to release Pluton, one needs to take down the walls protecting Wano, which is what “opening the country's borders” truly meant. When Robin enquired why Oden would do that, Sukiyaki explained that his own knowledge is what was passed down from his ancestors, and that he didn't know what his son might have learned during his travels.

Ryokugyu landed in Udon, where he used his  Mori Mori no Mi ability to cover the entire region in vegetation and attacked the Prison Mine where all the Beasts Pirates were being held and sucked out their vitality using roots he made with his ability. After calling in a battleship to Wano and commanding his subordinates to not mention this to Sakazuki, Ryokugyu then started moving onto the Flower Capital to take out Luffy, in order to gain Sakazuki's approval. However, the Red Scabbards (sans Kin'emon and Kikunojo) and Shinobu sensed him and recognized him as a Marine and an enemy of Luffy's, stood in his way. Ryokugyu then attacked them with , all the while ranting how, since the country was unaffiliated to the World Government, no one on the island had any human rights and that he would have no problem slaughtering the civilians' if it meant getting to Luffy, claiming genuine support for the World Government's discriminatory politics. At this point, Yamato appeared and knocked Ryokugyu down with a Haki infused swing from  Takeru, proclaiming his disgust at the Admirals remarks, and declaring himself as Kaidou's son, Yamato. Momonosuke then flew in and attempted to fire a , which failed, and instead charged at the Wood Man and bit him, declaring that he would drive the Admiral away, even telling Yamato to stay out of the fight. Ryokugyu managed to capture Momonosuke in his roots, prompting Raizo to attempt to free him with , however Ryokugyu defended with  before catching the ninja with a root and draining his vitality, and then proceeded to capture most of the others with his roots and branches. When Yamato proposed to bring in Luffy and the crew, Momonosuke refused and forbade him from fighting as well, wishing to prove that Wano could defend itself without the Straw Hats. In a moment of desperation and frustration, Momonosuke finally unleashes a , which burned straight through the Wood Man, and setting the Admiral's body on fire. However, Ryokugyu managed to revive himself from a sprout, and just as he was going to transform and continue attacking, it was cancelled out after feeling a burst of Haoshoku Haki aimed at him. Realizing that it was  Shanks, Ryokugyu decides to retreat quietly.

In the seas outside Wano, the Red Hair Pirates arrive, and having read the news on Luffy, discussed whether they would go see him, as he now definitely qualified as a great pirate, with  Yasopp hesitating to see Usopp, and  Limejuice complained about Kid. Shanks in the meantime recollected how the last time they were here they sent of Oden, before gazing at Luffy's  wanted poster and recalling how they first stole the Gomu Gomu no Mi, and his time with Luffy, including how he lost his arm. In the end Shanks decided against meeting Luffy, instead planning to confront  Bartolomeo who had been going around his territories and replacing their Jolly Roger with the Straw Hats. He then told  Benn Beckman it’s time they make their move and claim the One Piece. However, when he sensed Ryokugyu was preparing to get serious against Momonosuke, Shanks, recalling Luffy, Momonosuke, Hiyori and even  Uta as children, decided to interfere with a burst of Haoshoku Haki directed at the Admiral, which prompted Ryokugyu to retreat. Meanwhile, Luffy, Zoro, Sanji and Jinbe witnessed the scene in pride of Momonosuke's courage, while also wondering the source of the massive Haki burst, they had sensed then. Shortly afterwards, Yamato met up with the observing Straw Hats and stated his intention to stay on the island, as threats as strong as Ryokugyu may pop up again, claiming he would come up with an excuse to placate Momonosuke if he asked. Just as Luffy agreed, as it would take a load of his mind, Marco flew up and said his goodbyes, stating he found a passing ship close by (a.k.a. the Red Hair Pirates) who would be willing to take him home. When Luffy wished to express his thanks for the  Summit War of Marineford, Marco just brushed it off and flew away, but not before mentioning how Ace would be proud of his little brother if he could see him now.

Raizo and Shinobu are rushed back to the castle for treatment after being dehydrated by Ryokugyu. Kin'emon is likewise there and apologizes for his absence, revealing he was visiting his wife, O-Tsuru, to check on her after the destruction of Okobore Town. Though the rest of the Red Scabbards are understanding and don't blame him for it. Carrot is summoned by Inuarashi and Nekomamushi who explain that she will be the new duke of the  Mokomo Dukedom, having decided to stay in Wano to help look after the kingdom, much to her shock. They've based their decision on that she carries the spirit of Pedro in her and her experience after her time with the Straw Hats. Wanda and the Three Musketeers vow to help her watch over Zou as well, to Inuarashi and Nekomamushi's approval that their home is in capable hands. Meanwhile, Sukiyaki has revealed to Momonosuke and Hiyori that he is alive, news that brings joy to the two to know another of their family has survived. Sukiyaki assumes the other Scabbards knew of his survival which they confirm, though silently Kin'emon reveals he was the only one who wasn't aware of this. Sukiyaki tells the group he doesn't intend to retake his title as shogun and will continue to live among the people as Tenguyama, requesting they remain quiet over his identity. Over with the Straw Hats, Robin has told Luffy about Pluton, but Luffy shows no interest in it. They're greeted by Shinobu who has recovered from Ryokugyu's attack and even regained her slim figure. She also reveals she's taken Tama under her wing as a kunoichi apprentice. However, all are unaware that Caribou has been eavesdropping on their conversation and, intrigued at what he heard about the Pluton, he intends to tell a certain person about it.

Several days pass and the people of the Flower Capital have begun restoring the kingdom. Momonosuke goes to greet the Straw Hats but finds they've all left with Hiyori explaining they've all said their goodbyes to the others save for Momo and Kin'emon. At Tokage Port, the Straw Hats, Kid Pirates and the Heart Pirates are loading up supplies for their ships. Law declares their alliance has come to an end and the three crews are now rivals in finding the One Piece. Luffy, Kid and Law all pick their directions with Law going Northeast and Luffy and Kid wanting to go East. Luffy and Kid draw lots to determine who takes that route, which Luffy loses. During the argument, Kid shows, via newspaper, that Buggy has made a group called the  Cross Guild, a bounty hunting group who issue bounties on Marines for pirates to hunt. Among their members being Sir  Crocodile and Dracule Mihawk to Zoro's confusion to why he would join Buggy. As Kid declares it's every man for himself once they leave Wano, Law gives Killer a Poneglyph rubbing he got from Kaidou, citing they've earned it. In need of someone to translate it, Killer suggests going to look for a  certain man with a burn scar which peaks Luffy's and Robin's interest, though Kid refuse to disclose any information about him. Law seems likewise familiar with the individual in question but remains quiet.

Back at the castle, Momo and Kin'emon hear Yamato on the roof. Yamato declares she is going to go to the Straw Hats and intends to live the same way as Kozuki Oden.

Momonosuke, Kin'emon and Yamato race for the port on Momonosuke's dragon's form to confront the Straw Hats, with Yamato mentioning that he will stay in Wano and explore it a bit before heading out to sea, having already told the Straw Hats his decision. While surprised to hear this, the two samurai have no problem with it, focusing more on their anger at Luffy for not directly saying goodbye to them. Momonosuke thinking Luffy a hypocrite for his definition of freedom while reminiscing about their time together from through the whole ordeals. The three eventually arrive at Tokage Port as the pirate crews are about to set off. Momonosuke and Kin'emon tackle Luffy to express their anger, before Momonosuke tearfully breaks down and begs Luffy to stay. Explaining if it wasn't for him, he would've never found the courage to help free Wano Country from Kaidou's grasp. Luffy calls him a crybaby in response but assures Momonosuke he'll be fine, giving him a copy of the Straw Hat Pirates'  flag to fly over Wano. He tells Momonosuke that when times get tough, just look at it and remember their adventures to lift his spirits up and that if trouble should come, let their enemies know they're allies of his crew. Luffy parts with an invitation to Momonosuke, Kin'emon and Yamato that they can come sail with them whenever they feel ready for it.

The Straw Hats, Kid, and Heart Pirates depart with the Straw Hats formally wishing Momonosuke, Kin'emon, and Yamato well. As the latter three see them off, Momonosuke proclaims to Kin'emon that he'll surpass his father which Kin'emon is more than happy to see for himself. The Straw Hats and Heart Pirates start to head to Hakumai to take the elevator down but are insulted by Kid for taking the safer route and accept his challenge of sailing over the waterfall to the horror of their respective crews. Meanwhile, at a theater in the Flower Capital, the teacher who took  Sarahebi's place is telling the audience of the  Battle of Onigashima and how the Red Scabbards and Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance help defeat Kaidou, Big Mom and Orochi. In addition, Kaidou and Big Mom have become known to the people of Wano as "Dragon King" and "O-Lin the Great Yōkai" respectfully.  In the finale, he closes on Orochi's dying words of proclaiming the Kurozumi's will continue to curse the island for generations. Hiyori however counters with a play on words of her father's dying breath: "The Kurozumi's were made to burn!", dealing the final blow to the false Wano Shogun and ending his tyranny once and for all. Much to the jubilation of the theater's audience at this recount acne. Thus, after twenty years of strife, peace has returned to Wano, the rightful royal family has returned, and the arc closes with Momonosuke asking Yamato and Kin'emon where they should put the flag as the curtain closes on this particular chapter of the series.

## Final Saga

### __Egghead Arc__

#### Shifting Balance: The World's New Great Powers[]

After recovering from their dangerous descent down  Wano's waterfall,  Nami put  Luffy in a cage to punish him. They then received the  newspaper, learning of their new  bounties and about the many massive events that had occurred during their time on Wano. They were horrified at the news of  Cobra's death and  Vivi's disappearance. Luffy immediately wanted to go and rescue Vivi, but  Zoro talked him out of it, saying they should allow Vivi to take care of herself until it becomes clear she was in imminent danger. Luffy refused to believe that  Sabo would kill Cobra, recalling the time he declared his dream to Sabo and  Ace and thus revealing it to his crew for the first time. They reacted with a mixture of disbelief, wonder and glee.  Sanji laughed and said Luffy needed his brain examined.  Usopp said that such a thing would be impossible, but Luffy replied that the Pirate King might be able to do it.  Franky declared that they needed to find the last  Road Poneglyph to help their captain become Pirate King and achieve the dream as soon as possible, but  Robin adds that it would not be easy as its whereabouts had been unknown for a long period of time.

The  Red Hair Pirates dropped  Marco off back at  Sphinx, and as he bid farewell to them, Marco recalled his farewell with the Straw Hats on Wano.  Yamato had informed the crew of his decision not to join them, as he believed that Wano would need his protection for the time being from threats like  Ryokugyu. Marco then arrived to tell the crew he was about to leave, and he, Luffy, and  Jinbe reminisced about their first meeting in the  Summit War of Marineford. Marco said Ace would have certainly been delighted to see Luffy's growth.

On  Karai Bari Island,  Crocodile and  Mihawk confronted  Buggy over why he was being advertised as the leader of  Cross Guild, which in reality was created by the two of them. Some days ago, Crocodile contacted Mihawk as the now ex-Warlord was under attack by the  Marines and proposed that the two of them team up to take on the Marines. Later, as Buggy was under attack by the Marines, Crocodile arrived at Karai Bari Island and ambushed the attacking fleet. Buggy's henchman believed that Crocodile was working for him, but in reality, Crocodile was after him to collect the money Buggy owed him. With no options left, Buggy offered to work as a servant for Crocodile's new company in order to pay off his debt. However, Buggy's subordinates put their captain front and center when creating a poster to spread word about the Cross Guild, and the  World Government misinterpreted the poster as well as Crocodile's attack on the Marines to label Buggy as the company's leader and label him one of the  Four Emperors. Because of the massive threat posed by Cross Guild, Crocodile's bounty was raised to 1,965,000,000 while Buggy's was raised to 3,189,000,000 and Mihawk's raised to over 3,590,000,000. Although Crocodile was enraged by this development and proceeded to beat up Buggy in response, Mihawk stated that he had no desire to be an Emperor and that it might actually be advantageous for them if they were to keep Buggy as their figurehead leader, which Crocodile agreed to.

On  Amazon Lily,  Gloriosa comments that the island had suffered great damage and that they had never experienced an invasion of this magnitude before, to which  Boa Hancock replies that as long as she is there the Marines will not stop coming and adds that she should marry Luffy now, annoying Gloriosa who was already sick of her constantly bringing it up.

A few weeks ago,  Koby,  Yamakaji, and their fleet assaulted the island, bringing in the new line of  Pacifista,  Seraphim. The  Kuja were left in shock as they came under attack by  a cyborg resembling a young version of Hancock. The battle was then interrupted by the arrival of the  Blackbeard Pirates, who came to take Hancock's  Mero Mero no Mi power.  Blackbeard was attacked by  a Seraphim resembling a young Mihawk. Hancock used the opportunity to use her ability, turning the Marines and pirates except Koby and Blackbeard to stone. Blackbeard was able to grab hold of Hancock and nullify her ability. They arrived at a standstill as Hancock said that if she were killed, her victims would remain petrified, and Blackbeard would never be able to use her fruit to undo it. Blackbeard ultimately decided to kill her regardless but was stopped by the sudden arrival of  Rayleigh, who told the Emperor to depart the island and in return Hancock would reverse the petrification of his crew.

In the present day, Rayleigh remained on Amazon Lily along with  Shakky, who was the former Amazon Lily empress and  Kuja Pirates captain two generations before Hancock. He remarked it was fortunate everything went the way it did, as he was not sure he would have been able to take on Blackbeard in a battle at this point.

Out at sea, a Marine ship reported via  Den Den Mushi that they were setting course for  Egghead and that Koby's status was unknown as he had been kidnapped by the Blackbeard Pirates.

In the  Kamabakka Kingdom, the  Revolutionary Army officers expressed relief that Sabo was still alive, although  Dragon was concerned about the report of King Cobra's assassination and said he and Sabo would have a reckoning if he was indeed the one responsible for the incident. Dragon then went up to the liberated  Kuma and asked him what he had seen. Right then, the revolutionaries received a call from Sabo, which the Marines were able to intercept. They traced the location of the call to the  Lulusia Kingdom, which was one of the kingdoms that had revolted in the  Eight-Nation Revolution; the  Five Elders were made aware of this and remarked that Sabo was unlucky. In his call, Sabo told his comrades that he had not killed Cobra; in reality, he had seen something terrible. As he was saying this, the citizens of Lulusia looked up as a  massive object appeared in the sky, shrouded by clouds. As Sabo began to tell the revolutionaries that the  Empty Throne actually possessed an occupant,  Imu unleashed a rain of lasers from the sky which instantly obliterated Lulusia and left nothing in its wake; it was declared during this attack that Lulusia had never existed to begin with.

#### Arrival at Egghead: Meeting Dr. Vegapunk[]

A few days after their departure from Wano, the  Straw Hats were in a brutally cold climate zone as they approached their next island. They came across a giant  Warm Eddy, and spotted a person trapped inside it. Zoro cut through the eddy to free them, and  Jewelry Bonney emerged in child form. Luffy jumped in midair and stretched his arms to catch her as well as a blown-overboard  Chopper, but  the Sunny and crew then came under attack by  Mecha-Shark, a giant shark made out of metal. As Luffy, Bonney, and Chopper fell into the ocean, Jinbe went to rescue them while Franky tried piloting the Sunny out of harm's way. However, Mecha-Shark fired homing torpedoes out of its mouth, causing the Sunny to capsize and sink. It then attacked Jinbe's group with cannon fire as the fish-man tried to save the Devil Fruit users, forcing him to dive underwater to escape. Mecha-Shark turned its attention back to the Sunny but was suddenly punched by a person inside a  giant mecha.

Meanwhile, at the nearby Marine Base,  G-14,  Helmeppo and several other Marine officers pleaded to  Tashigi and Rear Admiral  Prince Grus to let them go and rescue Koby from  Hachinosu. Grus refused their request to deploy a Seraphim from Egghead, saying they were in no position to act as they had not been able to get a hold of  X Drake.

Jinbe brought Luffy, Chopper, and Bonney onto the nearby island, where they dried their clothes and got warm. Bonney revealed who she was to Luffy and told the three stranded Straw Hats that they were in Egghead, an island home to Dr.  Vegapunk's research labs and said to be 500 years in the future. She revealed that she came alone as she had business with Vegapunk, though her ship was devoured by Mecha-Shark before she could reach the island. The four then enter the island, where they were dazzled by the futuristic sights of aliens, giant robots and giant parfaits. However, upon interacting with them, they soon realized they were all holograms. Annoyed, Luffy punches a  large robotic girl that talked to him, only to find out it was real when he was punched back. He was knocked into the Automatic Food Machine, which the pirates were very delighted to discover and started playing around with it. As they ate the food dispensed from the machine, the girl started explaining some of the technology around them, the Island A.C. that kept the island warm despite being a winter island, and her Light Pressure Gloves that allow her to interact with holograms. When enquired who she was, she claimed to be Dr. Vegapunk, though Bonney, who said she knew the real Vegapunk, immediately claimed she was lying.

Meanwhile, the mecha that hit Mecha-Shark lifted the Sunny out of the ocean, along with the rest of the Straw Hats and a woman emerged from it, saying Mecha-Shark was a creation she built to guard the island but was acting awry due to its primal desires to eat ships. The woman then also introduced herself as Dr. Vegapunk, to the Straw Hats' great shock. However, when Robin questioned this, knowing for a fact the Vegapunk should be an elderly man, the woman expanded on this by revealing that she was  Punk-02, Lilith, not the  original Stella, before demanding the Straw Hats to hand over their treasure and surrounding them with giant  Sea Beast Weapons. However,  Punk-01, Shaka contacted Lilith, scolding her for plundering and warning her of the danger she is in, particularly from Zoro and Robin. After she had realized this, Zoro then started to make demands, with Shaka, who was interested in the crew, obliging. The giant mecha then flew with the Sunny to the top part of the island, the Labophase, as Lilith explained how the machine could currently only work in the vicinity of the island, and how the clouds around the top were  Island Clouds and that the lower area was the residential Fabiriophase. The Straw Hats, except for Zoro and  Brook, who remained on ship watch duty, then disembarked and obtained some new clothes. While the two swordsmen had tea on the ship, they released  Caribou and told him to disembark, despite his protests as the island was a government island.

On Luffy's group's side, after they had eaten their fill, Atlas flew off to do her job of fighting holograms, while the four discovered a Trancos clothes dispenser, and picked out some new attire. However, as they wandered around, a policing Pacifista attacked them, for not paying for the clothes and food. When Luffy attempted to fight back, Bonney intervened, tearfully revealing how Bartholomew Kuma was her father. They eventually managed to escape it thanks to Bonney's Devil Fruit ability altering Luffy and Chopper to their old age, while Jinbe and the Glutton became children, fooling the cyborg's detection. Jinbe then revealed what he knew about he knew about Kuma, such as how he was the king of  Sorbet Kingdom, but was driven out due to his tyranny before becoming affiliated with the Revolutionary Army only to be captured and imprisoned for life. He revealed that thanks to Vegapunk taking interest in him, Kuma gained his freedom as a Warlord at the cost of donating his body to science. However, as Bonney salvaged through a scrap heap, discovering a beam saber in the process, she contradicted many of these "facts", and believed her father would not have willingly sacrificed himself for science as he was apparently part of a certain race.

At sea, a ship from the World Government headed towards Egghead. On board,  Rob Lucci,  Kaku and  Stussy were going over their newest mission, the assassination of Vegapunk. As it turned out Dr. Vegapunk, somehow split himself amongst six more people, referred to as Satellites, as he had too much to do. In the process of delivering  S-Bear, the three are to assassinate all the Vegapunks with as little damage to the lab as possible. When Lucci pondered whether this order is due to what happened to Lulusia, the other agents warned him against inquiring needlessly. At around the same time Shaka, having foreseen his imminent death, contacted Dragon to tell him something.

Meanwhile, in the seas of  Winner Island, the  Polar Tang was under attack, and the  Heart Pirates suddenly started turning into women. Forced to surface, they soon found their attackers, the Blackbeard Pirates, waiting for them.  Law countered his feminization with a strong amount of  Haki, with  Doc Q, the one who spread the disease with his  Shiku Shiku no Mi ability, commenting that by doing so, the cure would also spread out amongst the crew.  Van Augur then used his  Wapu Wapu no Mi ability to teleport  Jesus Burgess to the island, who used his  Riki Riki no Mi ability to throw a mountain at the Heart Pirates, though Law countered it with his own ability. Teach himself appeared with Doc Q on top of  Stronger, who now could fly thanks to the  Uma Uma no Mi, Model: Pegasus. It is revealed that the Blackbeard captain launched this ambush in order to steal Law's copies of the Road Poneglyphs. Law then used his awakened ability  on Stronger to make them fall, though not before Teach used  to shake up the Heart Pirates and the island with it. Doc Q then threw a basket of explosive apples at his enemies, but  Shachi countered it by spitting out a jet of water to intercept the bombs.  Bepo then identified Augur's position and had  Jean Bart intercept his shot targeted at Law. Law faced Blackbeard, using  against the Emperor.

Augur saves Teach using his teleportation before placing him in front of Law, and just as the two clashed again, Teach used his . Meanwhile, the Heart Pirates display their aquatic fighting ability by attacking the Blackbeard Pirates ship from underwater. In the  Marine Headquarters, Fleet Admiral  Sakazuki expressed his frustration of his inability to do anything, as he received the news of the two crews fighting.

In the Labophase of Egghead, as the Straw Hats entered the lab, they marveled at the technology, such as the escalator and the phase-through door, while Lilith explained the island's mechanisms are powered through fire. The crew soon lost sight of Lilith but were guided to a room by  Edison over the speaker system, where they encountered  S-Shark. Jinbe's Seraphim Pacifista. Though at first confused, after the cyborg had attacked them, the Straw Hats quickly fought back, though they were hampered by S-Shark's combination of lasers,  Fish-Man Karate, his  Lunarian/ Fish-Man physique, cyborg modifications and an ability similar to the  Sui Sui no Mi. The battle was quickly put to an end by Shaka, who ordered S-Shark to stand down whilst restraining the pirates by magnetizing the DOM Shoes they were wearing to the floor. As it turns out, the battle was an experiment set up by the three satellites Lilith, Edison and  Pythagoras, to test out S-Shark in actual combat. Shaka then asked the four whether the island looked like the future to them, and though Franky gave an enthusiastic positive response, Shaka stated that this was an island of the past.

He goes on to state that the technology they used was mostly that which they recreated from an  ancient kingdom from 900 years ago. As he continued talking, Robin realized that he was referring to the  Void Century, with Shaka expanding that he theorized that  Ohara discovered the existence of the kingdom and that the Void Century was the history of the war between the Great Kingdom, and the 20 nations which later became known as the World Government, who won the war and erased its existence from history. The Straw Hats were shocked by this reveal, though Sanji then realized that this information would make them a target of erasure by the World Government if they knew that the pirates knew this, to which Shaka casually affirmed, causing some of the pirates to despair. Though the satellite stated it was but a theory, he questioned Robin that if Ohara were annihilated for simple conjecture, then this should probably mean that they were basically admitting it was true. However, Robin asked back of whether he really could get such information from being affiliated to the Government, to which he denied, and when she asked how he could have known this, Shaka stated that the "Will of Ohara" still exists.

He then tells his story of how he once knew Professor  Clover, who was an eccentric yet well-respected  Archaeologist/adventurer in his youth, whose charisma helped make Ohara the "holy land of archaeology". A few months after the  Ohara Incident, Vegapunk visited the remains of the island to pay his respects, where he came across the sight of a lake stuffed full to the brim with books, the final acts of the Oharan scholars. In doing so, they managed to safeguard their knowledge and legacy, and as such, secured Ohara's "victory". Hearing this, Robin recalled parting with her  mother and fellow archaeologists, and realized what her mother and old friends intended, causing her to tear up. Robin then affirmed Vegapunk's theory of the Oharans discoveries before asking where the books were now. Shaka then elaborated on the story, stating how the lakes were being dredged of the books by  giants of  Elbaf, being led by a giant covered in bandages. Vegapunk learnt their identities from Dragon, who arrived earlier to also pay his respects, and found out who they were directly from them. As the two paid their respects, Dragon who was then a captain of the  Freedom Fighters, expressed his disgust at not only what the World Government did to Ohara, but also at Vegapunk for turning his group down and working for them, though the scientist was practical stating that their poor group could not support his research.

Dragon then stated that he would create an army that could fight back against the World Government's injustices, which Vegapunk doubted due to Dragon's pacifistic nature. However, before the end of that year, Dragon, together with Kuma and Ivankov, established the Revolutionary Army. While the Straw Hats were shocked by all these revelations, Shaka continued to say how Vegapunk later visited Elbaf and read all the books from Ohara, with all that knowledge now stored in his brain. Robin however, wished to know if that bandage-wrapped giant leader was perhaps  Saul, and though Shaka did not confirm this, he did say that the giant was in hiding, which brought happy tears to Robin's eyes. He then dragged the Straw Hats to the monitor room using their Dom Shoes, allowing them to see their captain on the surveillance.

Meanwhile, in the Fabiriophase, Luffy's group managed to get lost and stumble upon an  Iron Giant in the Scrap Heap, with Luffy excitedly wishing to ride it. However, all of a sudden, something impacted the machine, and the next moment they found a man half stuck to the Iron Giant, exclaiming how his warping experiment failed and that he was sinking into the machine. Luffy saved him, and the man happily recognized Luffy and Bonney, though Bonney was not happy to see him, realizing the man as the original Dr. Vegapunk. When Luffy exclaimed at his hovering, Vegapunk explained to them how they could use their DOM Shoes to do the same, with Luffy, Chopper and the doctor accidentally flying off too high in the process. A bit later, Bonney demanded to know what happened to his head, to which Vegapunk casually replied that it grew too big, and he had to cut it, though he was shocked when Luffy asked if he was now stupid. Vegapunk then explained that, even though he was already a genius, he had eaten the  Nomi Nomi no Mi, which allowed him to store an unlimited amount of knowledge but caused his brain to continuously grow to accommodate. But since it was too big, he turned his brain into  Punk Records, the giant egg in which the Labophase is contained, and he can access all this information thanks to the apple top antenna he replaced his brain with. He then explained about his satellites, each containing an aspect of his personality, and how he divided his work amongst the six, with all of them updating their experiences and ideas to Punk Records daily. Vegapunk shared his intent to one day allow humanity to have access to it, essentially allowing humankind to share a brain, though Jinbe questioned whether there would have issues if dangerous ideologies were included, the doctor brushed it off, in favor for more knowledge.

His statement however, angered Bonney who drew the beam saber on the doctor and demanded he turn her father back to normal. Despite being threatened, Vegapunk insisted that she turn off the saber as it was a failure, and though she refused, stating that it cuts well enough, the doctor elaborated by stating that the light of the beam attracts bugs, just as a huge swarm of insects surged toward her causing her to faint in fear. After she had fainted and the insect swarm left, Chopper attended to her, and Vegapunk became depressed, stating that he could not blame her for wanting to kill him. He then inquired about the second dragon in Wano, coming to the conclusion that it must have been his failed  Artificial Devil Fruit, though Luffy claimed it was a success as  Momonosuke was capable of doing nearly everything  Kaidou was. Vegapunk then asked about its color, and Luffy stated it was pink, the scientist became more depressed insisting it was a failure, revealing that he was a perfectionist, and that the Artificial Devil Fruit was a failed product solely because of the color. When Luffy then asked about the Iron Giant, Vegapunk explained that they did not build it, and that it was made approximately 900 years ago, but 200 years ago it climbed up the  Red Line and nearly attacked  Mary Geoise, but suddenly stopped before it did any damage. It was supposed to be disposed of, but the scientists of that time preserved it instead. After stating how he felt bad for Bonney and that he needed to give her something, Vegapunk then requested Luffy to take him off Egghead.

In the Labophase monitor room, the Straw Hats observe their captain talking to Vegapunk, and when the talk of the Iron Giant came up, Shaka explained how he built the Vegaforce-01 based on the older robot, but he was unable to replicate the machine's dynamic power source. Soon after,  CP0 started breaking through the Sea Beast Weapon defense line, with Pythagoras being notified and spreading the news to the other satellites and Straw Hats. Though Lilith suggested handing the pirates over, Shaka ordered that they tell the agents to drop the Seraphim and immediately leave while preparing them for battle much to everyone's surprise.

On Momoiro Island, the Revolutionaries are in disarray when Kuma, who was undergoing repairs, suddenly gets up and starts running and falling over continuously as he heads to the coast, with no regards of his own safety or the voices of his old friends. As they pursued him, Kuma ripped of the implements used to fix him, before using his  Nikyu Nikyu no Mi ability to transport himself from the island.

Back on Egghead, in the Scrap Heap, Luffy questioned why Vegapunk wanted to leave, to which he explained how he wished to create endless, free energy for all mankind, though this did not impress the Straw Hat captain. When Jinbe stated that a lack of resources to create energy is one of the main causes of war, Vegapunk enthusiastically expanded on that, stating how energy was everywhere and that he wished to convert it into a form that can be seen and harnessed, though Luffy was still unimpressed. The scientist then revealed that his research into this led him to the "ancient energy" which was the power source of the Iron Giant. Their conversation is then interrupted by an explosion caused by CP0 landing on the island, prompting Vegapunk to wrap things up by stating that he took too much interest in the Void Century and now the Government wants to get rid of him. After briefly explaining what the CP0 were to Luffy, he again requested for the Straw Hats to take him, which the captain approved of, on account that he found the scientist's head funny. Vegapunk then decided they should reconvene in the Labophase and requested they bring Bonney with them, and after Luffy had agreed, the scientist literally vanished before their eyes.

#### CP0's Infiltration: Vegapunk is Targeted[]

In the Labophase, Pythagoras attempted to civilly ask the agents to have S-Bear return by itself, and for the rest of them to turn back. Lucci, suspecting that Vegapunk was onto them, asked if they knew about the Egghead Disappearances, how Government ships from CP5, CP7, and CP8, who had visited the island within the last two months, all disappeared. The Vegapunks seemed unaware of this, with Pythagoras claiming all three ships visited and left their port safely, and Lilith getting angry at their insinuation and even considering letting them in just to prove themselves, though in the end the satellites again requested they leave, before cutting communications. However, Pythagoras soon reported that the Sea Beast Weapons were consuming the Government ship, while the agents and S-Bear were spotted in the Fabiriophase. Coming to the conclusion that they used S-Bear's replicated Nikyu Nikyu no Mi ability to transport themselves onto the island, Shaka came to the conclusion that the agents were determined to fight, and started giving out orders, having the researchers and workers evacuate, to have Atlas return and to mobilize S-Shark, S-Snake and S-Hawk, while putting  Sentomaru in charge of them.

As the Government ship approached Egghead, they were attacked by the Sea Beast Weapons, with the CP0 agents fighting back. The agents then discussed reports of Jewelry Bonney heading to Egghead and contemplated killing her. Pythagoras then contacted them, politely asking them to have S-Bear return by itself and for them to leave. Lucci then decided to abandon the ship to the Sea Beast Weapons and had S-Bear use its ability to transport them to the island. Once they land in the Fabiriophase, Kaku excitedly attacks a space monster that seems to be trying to attack them, though just as he attacks, Stussy, who had been on the island before, mentions it was a hologram, which elicits an annoyed reaction that she should have mentioned that first. However, as he was already in the air, Kaku decided to try to enter the Labophase using , when Stussy casually mentioned to Lucci that the double lines running the circumference of Punk Records was actually a border known as the Frontier Dome and those who cross it gets shot down by laser fire, which Kaku unintentionally triggers, causing them to fall down all burnt.

Just as a burnt up Kaku yells at Stussy for again mentioning things too late, Atlas charged at them and wound up for an attack, but Lucci quickly transformed into his hybrid  leopard form and used  on her, instantly knocking her out and badly damaging the large robot. At this point the Jinbe, Chopper, Luffy and the still unconscious Bonney ran right in front of the agents, with Lucci and the rubber man instantly recognizing each other. While temporarily surprised at each other's presence, Luffy quickly ran towards Atlas in concern, and seeing her condition, requested Chopper to take care of her. Kaku cautioned Lucci from engaging them, as Luffy was now considered an Emperor, and that they were not permitted to engage one without approval from their superiors, as it could potentially lead to an unwanted war, however a fight soon broke out regardless as the Straw Hats went to support their assassination target.

Meanwhile, at Marine HQ, Sakazuki learnt of the Straw Hats presence on Egghead, with the Marines assuming that Vegapunk recruited them after realizing CP0 was targeting him for assassination. After learning that  Kizaru was already heading to Egghead on a different mission, the Fleet Admiral then ordered them to contact CP0 and demand that they wait for Marine reinforcement and to not engage the pirates. Kizaru soon learnt of his new orders and promptly ordered all battleships they could mobilize to set course for Egghead. However, at Marine Base G-14,  Doll argued with Vice Admiral  Garp over the Den Den Mushi, trying to stop him as the base mobilized their battleships to head for Egghead. However, the Hero simply yelled for Helmeppo, who heard him, and told them that he was going to Blackbeard's base Hachinosu, to beat up the pirates and rescue Koby, while inviting him aboard.

In the meantime, Kuma, having used his ability to transport himself, ended up colliding into the Red Line, and falling into  Red Port. He then attempted to climb up the continent, though was met with great resistance as the Marines fired mortars at him, causing him to fall of the wall. They continued to attack him while calling for back up, as the former Warlord while single-mindedly attempting to ascend the continent. Elsewhere, the  Kid Pirates sighted Elbaf.

Back on Egghead, as Luffy and Lucci engaged each other in their awakened forms, in the Labophase, the original Vegapunk appeared in the monitor room and asked the Straw Hats about their captain's new form, though they were also clueless, believing it to be an extension of his rubber powers. However, Vegapunk then revealed that none of the old books ever mentioned the  Gomu Gomu no Mi, and instead he drew comparisons between  and the legends of the Sun God,  Nika. He then stated his shocking theory to the Straw Hats, that Devil Fruits themselves were manifestation of the possibility for human evolution, with all the different powers representing the many branches for humanity's future, brought into existence by human hope and desire, though this unnatural state ended up making them loathed by the sea. When Sentomaru entered the battlefield with the other Seraphim, thinking he was going to support CP0, he was shocked when Vegapunk informed him that the agents were there to kill the scientist. Vegapunk then guilt-tripped the Marine with the favors the scientist did for him in the past, forcing him to go against the agents. As the Seraphim joined the battle, Franky started weeping, having recognized S-Shark's ability, and believing  Senor Pink to be dead, though Vegapunk then revealed his research in Artificial Devil Fruits, with him having greater success with  Zoan (though it was highly limited and expensive with  Mythical Zoans), virtually no results with  Logia, and his success with  Paramecia, which he replicated using  Lineage Factor to create  Green Blood, which all the Seraphim possess, declaring the cyborgs to be the "strongest form of humanity".

In the Fabiriophase, Luffy and Lucci both used awakening, though in spite doing so, the CP0 agent struggled to land a single blow on the pirate. When Sentomaru appeared with three more Seraphim, Kaku attempted to have S-Bear eliminate at least one of the cyborgs, before remembering that in terms of the Pacifista's authority hierarchy, they, who possessed the Authority Chips held less priority than the Marine. Sentomaru then ordered S-Bear to wipe out the agents, S-Snake to guide the pirates to the Vacuum Rocket and S-Shark and S-Hawk to hold back CP0. Lucci, having observed the situation after being knocked back by Luffy's , attacked Sentomaru with  in an attempt to usurp control over the cyborgs. Though the Marine managed to defend himself in time, it was still penetrated, leaving him with a mortal wound. Luffy, shocked that the Marine he was just chatting with during the lull of battle was attacked, sent Lucci flying with a  before he could finish the job, though the recoil of the attack sent him comedically drilling into the ground. In the meantime, the Seraphim demonstrated their replicated Devil Fruit abilities against the Cipher Pol minions, with S-Bear firing a small  and S-Snake using . Lucci reappeared and again ran at Sentomaru with , though Luffy blocked his way by emerging from underground with a gigantified head and attempted to chomp him. The leopard-man dodged it, but the Sun God then spat the rubble in his mouth at him and used the opening to defeat Lucci with a .

Luffy then quickly reunited with his friends at the Vacuum Rocket, but not before promising Sentomaru that he would take Vegapunk off the island. After boarding the Rocket, Luffy deactivated his awakening, quickly aging in appearance, whilst Bonney suddenly regained consciousness and expressed her confusion. They quickly reached the Labophase, where Bonney angrily started to look for Vegapunk, irrationally blaming him for the bugs attack, with the intent of forcing him to restore her father, or else. In the Labophase, the Straw Hats in the monitor room question Vegapunk joining them, as well as why the Government would want to eliminate their greatest scientific mind, though they quickly understood after the scientist questioned back what they would do if said mind were to turn on them. In the Fabiriophase, with Sentomaru finally unconscious, the CP0 now have control over the Seraphim, but were now met with the Frontier Dome's virtually impenetrable defense. They decide to cordon of the island to prevent escape.

When Stussy questioned Lucci's decision to fight Luffy, the agent simply stated that he did not see Luffy as an Emperor. All of a sudden, the security seemed to knock off, and though Lucci wished to exercise caution, believing it to be a trap, when the three agents used  to reach the Labophase and still did not receive a counterattack, Kaku believed that this was an opportunity. The three then spotted the Thousand Sunny, and at Lucci's order Kaku attacked it with . Thankfully Zoro, who was napping aboard the ship cancelled out the attack and engaged the agents. As it turns out Bonney had found Vegapunk and pursued him through the facility, demanding he restore her father, even though he could not and that he had a good reason.

The Vegapunks then assembled, with Stella packed up to depart. As they contemplated how to escape, since CP0 had cordoned off the island, Lilith opted to use force, which Shaka vetoed, and while Pythagoras mentioned that they had one more ally, Edison stated that supporting them would result in said ally being pursued by the Government. This did not stop Vegapunk requesting the mysterious ally for help, who easily obliged. Vegapunk then requested the Straw Hats for permission to board their ship for all seven, which was met with mixed reactions from the pirates. However, much to the scientists' surprise, the Frontier Dome was deactivated, despite seemingly no one being in the control room, allowing the agents as well as the Seraphim to infiltrate before they could reactivate their defenses. Meanwhile Luffy managed to reunite with the rest of his crew, and though he was disappointed in leaving early, he quickly realized he lost sight of Bonney.

In the monitor room the Straw Hats and the satellites observed the situation outside, and though they thought Brook and Zoro might be able to hold on in a two vs. three match, Shaka revealed that the Seraphim followed the agents, most likely due to their limited personality judging they would be needed there. The satellites decided to take advantage of this, with Lilith and Edison heading towards the Seraphim to order them to fight CP0, with Franky and Sanji following to assist their crewmates. This left Nami and Usopp with Shaka who started panicking when CP0 ordered the Seraphim to destroy the lab.

At some point he managed to hide from her, though taking advantage of his naivete, she regressed her age into a child and started weeping crocodile tears, which drew him out. She then used  to assume a muscular form, before using  to regress Vegapunk into a child. Having captured him, she demanded to know the reason for her father's lobotomy, though Vegapunk claimed that the truth would only hurt Bonney, and that he promised Kuma that he could never tell her, insisting that Kuma himself volunteered for this. Though she claimed he was lying, Vegapunk insisted that he loved Kuma as a dear friend and was proud of him, how doing what he did was so hard he wished to forget it, and that was why he could not tell her, though Bonney refused to accept this. At that moment a locked door started beeping, drawing Bonney's attention, and though the child-sized Vegapunk tried to stop her, Bonney eroded the lock with , and opened the door to reveal a large paw-shaped bubble. Vegapunk then recalled how he theorized together with Kuma that his abilities may work on other things, like memories, and requested that the Warlord try it out, though Kuma persistently refused. In the present, Vegapunk attempted to stop Bonney from touching it by claiming the bubble was pain, but Bonney knew that it was most likely memories as she slowly approached it. Bonney saw a bit of Kuma's childhood when he was running away from something and beaten by assailants for trying to flee. Overwhelmed by the sight, Bonney fell out of the memory world but resolved to reenter so she could understand her father's motives.

As Zoro fought Kaku, the other two agents soon found that the Seraphim had followed them by their own discretion and realized that they could not send them back down as the defense system has reactivated. Meanwhile, Kaku entered his awakened form and fought Zoro though the swordsman repelled him. Knowing that they would lose control if a Vegapunk were to give the Seraphim a direct command, Lucci ordered the cyborgs to destroy the lab before the scientists could get their chance.

While Kaku looked at the destruction in satisfaction, the two male agents noticed too late that Stussy had approached the giraffe-man and knocked him out by sucking his blood. A  clone of  Buckingham Stussy of the  Rocks Pirates, she was secretly Vegapunk's ally. She dodged Lucci's attack before subduing him as well, using Seastone hidden within a lipstick tube to weaken him before biting him. Stussy then contacted Shaka to inform that she had taken care of the Cipher Pol agents, surprising the Straw Hats with him that he has a mole within the World Government. However, Stussy could not override Lucci's command to the Seraphim. Zoro and Brook defended the lab, as Lilith and Edison rushed outside. When Lilith tried to shout out an order, S-Hawk prepared to attack her, and although Zoro managed to block it, Lilith was too frightened to continue. Edison arrived shortly after and managed to order the Seraphim to stop, but Sanji had to save Edison from S-Shark's laser beam. This finally ceased the attack on the lab. After Stussy bound Lucci and Kaku with Seastone, Shaka invited her to join the Satellites on the Straw Hats' ship. Meanwhile, Luffy and Chopper began searching around for Vegapunk and Bonney.

On Sphinx, the residents informed Marco that the Marines had invaded looking for  Whitebeard's treasure. The Marine captain,  Ratel, had threatened to execute them one by one until they would admit where it was. However, Weevil had arrived to defend his father's hometown and fought off the Marines, forcing them to retreat and request backup. Ryokugyu was sent and had subdued and captured Weevil. After the story finished, Miss Buckin, formerly known as Buckingham Stussy, an ex-Rock pirate and a former member of MADS as well, demanded that Marco rescue her son and tell her where Whitebeard's treasure was. Marco thanked her for protecting the island, but she assumed that he doubted her son's lineage and offered to have Vegapunk prove it. In a fleet of Marine and World Government ships making their way to Egghead, Kizaru served tea to Saint  Jaygarcia Saturn, one of the Five Elders.

#### Vegapunk Search Operation: The Labophase Death Game[]

Back on Egghead, Sentomaru had awakened and ordered a Pacifista Mark III to detain the other Cipher Pol agents in the Fabiriophase. Still unable to contact Vegapunk or receive reports from the outside world, Sentomaru deployed all fifty Pacifistas Mark III and ordered them to aid in the Straw Hats' escape with Vegapunk.

In the Labophase, Luffy, Zoro, Brook, and Stussy regrouped with the others after Luffy was unable to find Vegapunk or Bonney. Checking the monitors, Shaka noted that Bonney was in Room Nikyu but could not see Vegapunk anywhere. Pythagoras was already on the lookout for main body, and seeing as they could not leave without Vegapunk, Nami suggested the crew go look as well. Luffy and Zoro stayed behind to look after the unconscious Lucci and Kaki. As Pythagoras was searching, someone approached him from behind, and an explosion went off in part of the lab.

In his news balloon,  Morgans learned that the World Government was attempting to assassinate Vegapunk and that Luffy was also on Egghead. When he considered writing that Luffy was holding Vegapunk hostage and waging war with the World Government over it, Nefertari Vivi rebuked him for mischaracterizing Luffy.  Wapol urged her to be quiet out of fear that the World Government could overhear, as well as reminding her that Morgans was hiding them both. Morgans dismissed Vivi's opinion, stating that his main concern was what sold as entertainment.

Back at the lab, Shaka sees Pythagoras being attacked on the camera Den Den Mushi and tries to contact him, but suddenly notices a figure attack the camera and cut the feed. Luffy likewise notes he cannot hear the others over the radio anymore. When he goes to tell Shaka this, Shaka points out the cameras all over Egghead are being taken out. Meanwhile the Straw Hats and Stella units have formed into teams to explore the lab to look for Vegapunk. Nami, Brook and Edison search the third floor of Building A where Nami finds a machine that produces jewelry which she is ecstatic over and tries to take a few, but is forced to leave them behind to continue the search (though insists on retrieving them later).

Robin, Chopper, and Atlas searched the second floor of Building A, a section which manufactured artificial organs to Chopper's amazement. On the second floor of the right side of Building B. Sanji, Stussy and Jinbe search the development floor. On the third floor on the left side of Building C are Usopp, Lilith,  York, and Franky, the four arriving at the area where Pythagoras was attacked and finding his body. However, he survived by ejecting from his bigger body before he was hit. York then found S-Snake nearby, and Pythagoras yelled out to York to stay away from her. However, having Hancock's Mero Mero no Mi powers, S-Snake turned her to stone. When Lilith ordered her to stand down, S-Snake attacked the group and forced them to jump off the platform.

Lilith and Edison were confused as they should have the higher clearance to command the Seraphim, and then the group noted the communication devices had malfunctioned, and they cannot contract the main control room. Back in Building A, the lab was suddenly attacked by S-Bear and S-Hawk to the similar confusion of Shaka as Luffy and he arrived on the scene, finding Zoro trying to fend them off so they would not kill a still bound and helpless Lucci and Kaku. After the group had barely avoided an attack from the two Seraphim, Shaka noted that someone in the base was commanding them to kill everyone inside. Lucci requested the three untie him and Kaku to help with the situation, a suggestion that Luffy and Zoro did not take favorably.

The Seraphim continue their attacks (at one point Zoro noticing that S-Hawk is wielding  Mr. 1's  Supa Supa no Mi power) forcing Luffy and Zoro to pull Lucci and Kaku out of danger. Kaku proposes once again Lucci, and he be freed, even promising to return to their cuffs once the threat is dealt with, but Zoro remains unconvinced. Shaka questions Lucci what their mission is to Egghead which Lucci bluntly answers that it was to kill Vegapunk and the Satellites. Also putting Stussy on his hitlist for her earlier betrayal. Seeing that they likely have no choice, Luffy agrees to free them but only with the condition Lucci only come after went after his assigned targets only once he defeats Luffy himself. A term Lucci surprisingly agrees with stating he intends to kill Luffy before his crew. With that, the two CP0 agents are freed and work together with Luffy and Zoro to fight the Seraphim.

In the basement floor of the old Devil Fruit research lab, Cipher Pol agents from CP5, 7 and 8 were being kept prisoner, being held there for two months without almost no food or water. Vegapunk finds himself awakening there and surprised to find that Lucci's statement of agents disappearing near the island were truth as one of the agents reveal they were chased back to the island by his Sea Beast Weapons and captured, with the following agents investigating their disappearances meeting the same fate. Vegapunk worries about this occurrence as there should have been no way the World Government knows about him studying Poneglyphs.

Meanwhile on the island of Elbaf, in a bar of one of the coastal villages, a young giant asks  Shanks to take him with him but is refused for being too young.  Rockstar then entered in to inform Shanks someone is fighting their crew near the island. Shanks chides himself for taking so long to leave but promises the residents he will not let the island become a warzone. The rest of the Red Hair Pirates follow after him, joined along with  Dorry and  Brogy at Shanks' request to fight the incoming threat, who turned out to be the Kid Pirates. Shanks tells Rockstar to give Kid a message: either fight there and now or leave their Road Poneglyphs and flee. Out at sea,  Eustass Kid and  Killer notice the ships their fighting are crews allied with the Red Hair Pirates. Killer asks Kid if he truly wishes to continue as their last encounter with the crew ended with their defeat, not even seeing Shanks and the loss of Kid's left arm, with the added risk of the pirates killing him if he loses to them again. Kid confirms he is not backing down and proceeds onward to battle.

Back at Egghead, in the city, the citizens ask Sentomaru why he deployed the Pacifista with the only answer Sentomaru can give being that the island is about to suffer the same fate of Ohara and hoped the Straw Hats can get Vegapunk off the island. Back in the Command Floor, Luffy, Zoro, Lucci and Kaku continue to battle the Seraphim, but their attacks did not seem to affect S-Hawk and S-Bear. Zoro noticed the two seem similar to  King which Shaka surmises must have been the Lunarian, then named Alber, that had escaped with Kaidou in the past. Zoro informed the others about the flames on their back and their vulnerability once its off (humorously getting chided by them for not noticing the Lunarian features sooner during the fight). As the others re-engage the battle, Shaka heads off by himself, thinking he knew where Vegapunk was.

In 3F, Building A, Nami and Zeus battled S-Shark, who had defeated Brook and Edison. However, as with the other Seraphim, Nami attacks hardly affect him as she held back as the Seraphim were children. Just as S-Shark is about to ambush her with his Sui Sui no Mi, Sanji arrives and knocks S-Shark back. Over in Building C, Lilith tries to subdue S-Snake with her bubble gun which she reveals has the same properties of Seastone, citing since the green blood gives them their Devil Fruit powers, it likewise gives them their weaknesses. While S-Snake dodged her attack, Franky manages to briefly incapacitate her with one of the bubbles. However, he fell for S-Snake's crocodile tears and accidently released her, to which she uses her kicks to turn most of his body to stone and turns Lilith and Usopp to stone as well when they try to stop her, thanks to the two falling for her charms.

In the basement floor of the old Devil Fruit research lab, Shaka found where Vegapunk and the Cipher Pol agents are imprisoned. However, just as he was about to free them, Vegapunk noticed someone else in the room who proceeds to shoot Shaka with a pistol and destroy his helmet, much to Vegapunk's horror.

In 2F of Building B. Stussy and Jinbe have continued with their search, the former contacting Sentomaru informing him of the World Government sending in the CP0 first then a Marine fleet to come destroy Egghead due to Vegapunk studying Poneglyph and the island having military weapons that could rival them. With his fears of a  Buster Call confirmed, Sentomaru ordered the citizens of the island to evacuate.

Back in 3F of Building C, S-Snake stands unopposed as Franky is unable to do anything due to being half petrified in stone. She proceeds to stomp on the helpless Pythagoras and destroy him before turning her attention to Franky. Robin's group hear the noise from building A and worry for their friends' safety, Atlas then remembers the abandoned research section and leads Robin and Chopper to the area of the lab. Meanwhile Sanji takes over the fight against S-Shark, the latter who cannot seem to harm him thanks to Sanji's new awakened Germa enhancements, while Nami and Brook tend to Edison.

Luffy's group find that the Seraphim will not let their flames go out to harm them. In addition, S-Hawk disappeared which Lucci presumed is to deal with the weaker targets first. Zoro took off to go find him, with Luffy ordering Kaku to follow after to make sure he does not get lost while Lucci and he continue to fight S-Bear. Elsewhere, Bonney continued to cry over Kuma's memories.

In a flashback three months prior to the story's events, someone from Egghead had contacted the Five Elders to inform them of Vegapunk's research and weaponry development. This had prompted the Five Elders to send Cipher Pol agents to investigate. In the present day, the shooter of Shaka was revealed to be York, who had been unpetrified. When Vegapunk asked why she was doing this, York revealed her wish to become a Celestial Dragon, despite knowing how despicable they were, and intended to be the only Vegapunk left standing. Another flashback showed that York had realized the World Government would not just kill Vegapunk, but all of the Satellites as well, including her. Therefore, she secretly had commanded the Seraphim to kill everyone except her, Vegapunk, and the Cipher Pol hostages. She had also specifically ordered S-Snake to turn her to stone in front of the others and then turn her back to normal when they were separated, as well as having S-Snake head off toward a secret area of the lab. In the present day, the citizens fled Egghead, but a ship bearing the Blackbeard Pirates' flag made its way to the island.

#### The Unstoppable Emperors: Turbulence in the New World[]

Near Elbaf, the Kid Pirates were confronted by Shanks' allies, but Shanks ordered them aside. After checking up on Kid's bounty and statistics, Shanks foresaw Kid using his  to devastate the fleet, so he immediately rushed to the  Victoria Punk and sliced the railgun in half before Kid had a chance to fire it. Shanks' strike and the resulting explosion knocked out both Kid and Killer, who had tried to defend his captain. The Kid Pirates who had withstood Shanks' Haoshoku Haki burst quickly surrendered and offered the Road Poneglyph rubbings in exchange for sparing their lives. Shanks took the rubbings and left the Victoria Punk before Dorry and Brogy's  hit the ship, splitting it in half and sinking the Kid Pirates.

Meanwhile on Hachinosu, Koby has managed to escape from captivity thanks to  Perona, who in turn requested he free  Gecko Moria for her assistance. His escape was soon noticed, with the pirate inhabitants after him for his Cross Guild bounty. In the process of his escape, he freed several captured Marines and rushed off to act as a decoy so that they may escape. Three of Blackbeard's commanders,  Shiryu,  Avalo Pizarro and  Vasco Shot (the latter two now wielding the  Shima Shima no Mi and  Gabu Gabu no Mi respectively) discussed how to go about capturing him while  Sanjuan Wolf (who wields the  Deka Deka no Mi) slept nearby. In a flashback, after Koby was captured following the Rocky Port incident. Blackbeard planned to use him as leverage against the World Government to force them to turn Hachinosu into a legitimate kingdom with him as the  king.

However, Koby revealed he was a member of SWORD which  Kuzan elaborates are Marine personnel that resigned from the main branch and act as an independent group without having to follow any orders from the top. Though this likewise means the Marines will disavow any responsibility for their action. Thus, Koby will be useless as a bargaining chip. This does not deter Blackbeard who figured Koby's reputation will make them reconsider and had Koby chained and locked up, though he was later freed by Perona. Back in the present, as Koby continued to flee from the pirate horde, he noticed an explosion in another section of the town. This is revealed to be several Marines who have invaded the island. One of the pirates manages to behead a Marine only for him to find out he is made of clay. In another section of the island, the pirates meet a female Marine Rear Admiral named  Kujaku,  Tsuru's granddaughter, who wields the  Muchi Muchi no Mi and was whipping the surrounding buildings to force them to move to form an enclosure. Koby soon found himself surrounded and the pirates made to shoot him, only for their bullets to turn into flowers. This is shown to be the work of  Hibari using GP Flowers to stop their assault. She signals over to Prince Grus, who wields the  Gunyo Gunyo no Mi and the creator of the artificial golem Marines, that Koby is okay.

Kujaku and Grus then cornered the pirates into a town square with his clay golems and her whip powers moving the buildings to create an enclosure. With the setup complete, Tashigi and Helmeppo yell to Garp that they are ready and have his Marine ship shoot into the air (similar to Franky's ) toward the square. Garp made himself known to the pirates, who were unable to run due to the buildings blocking their path, stating their mistake in capturing his protégé before striking the lot with  which proceeded to demolish the area. Grus used his clay power to cushion the landing of Garp's ship as Garp goes to confront the pirates, lamenting his strength not being as strong as it used to be. Koby and Hibari go to greet him, but the latter is suddenly frozen by an arriving Kuzan, much to the shock of the Marines, with Garp demanding to know what he is doing.

A flashback shows that a year after Akainu and Aokiji's battle at  Punk Hazard, some of Blackbeard's crew confronted Kuzan at a bar not long after he had quit the Marines following his fight with Akainu. Kuzan easily froze them, forcing Blackbeard and the remainder of his crew to confront him personally. The two managed to cordially talk over drinks.  Devon asked him about a  man with a burn scar who holds one of the Road Poneglyphs, sailing on an all-black ship that forms whirlpools to ships that try to approach it. Shiryu speculates that said man might work for the World Government to keep pirates from reaching the  One Piece, but Kuzan has no knowledge about any of it. A fight almost breaks out when Kuzan overheard  Laffitte suggesting that Blackbeard steal Kuzan's Devil Fruit, but Blackbeard diffuses the situation by offering Kuzan to join his crew since he was not with the Marines anymore and pirates generally join together due to an alignment of interests, asking what Kuzan wished to do now. In the present, Kuzan reveals himself as the tenth captain of the Blackbeard Pirates, forcing Garp to engage him in a clash between former teacher and student. Kuzan attempted to freeze Garp with , though the Hero of the Marines quickly broke out and punched Kuzan through the ground with .

Back on Winner Island, the Blackbeard Pirates emerged victorious against Law having defeated the Heart Pirates and destroyed their submarine, with Teach contemplating whether to take the  Ope Ope no Mi for himself, sell it or have Law do the surgery to give him eternal life.  Bepo then used a medicine given to him by Chopper at Wano to transform into his Sulong form, allowing him to knock Blackbeard back, grab Law and escape into the sea to prevent Blackbeard from following them. A weakened Law insists they cannot leave their crew behind, but Bepo stated they have survived this far and to have faith in them while ensuring Law survives in the meantime.

At New Marineford HQ,  Sengoku and Tsuru are reading a newspaper about  T Bone's death and they show their concern about people turning on the Marines thanks to the new Cross Guild bounties. When Sengoku asks Hina where Garp is, she revealed to them Garp and Kujaku's mission to Hachinosu to the shock of Sengoku and Tsuru.

On Karai Bari Island, Buggy congratulates the man who killed T Bone, even though said man only did it to help his destitute family and is clearly distraught over his actions. Buggy assures him he is under his protection and that his family will be compensated via the bounty reward. As the crew celebrates, one of Buggy's shipwrights announced the completion of the Cross Guild flagship. But to Buggy's dismay, they designed it in his likeness, which did not please Crocodile and Mihawk who dismember and beat up Buggy in private for it. The two then discuss how to go about their operations in becoming a military like power, but Buggy speaks out against them, finding their dreams to be too small-minded.

He reminisced his confrontation with Shanks at  Loguetown, after  Roger's execution, where he thought that Shanks would take up Roger's mantle of being the Pirate King after he died and was willing to go sail with him. However, to his shock, Shanks declined to do so, having other intentions in mind, though still wanted Buggy to join his crew. Buggy refused under the excuse of him being mad about losing the treasure map that resulted in him swallowing the  Bara Bara no Mi, but in truth felt betrayed by Shanks' change in plans. Mihawk and Crocodile were not swayed and state they do not have any interest in going after the One Piece or in claiming the heads of Shanks, Blackbeard and Luffy. Buggy takes matters into his own hands by announcing over a Den Den Mushi that the Cross Guild was going after the One Piece, much to the ire of his two partners.

#### King Cobra Assassinated: The Truths of the Levely[]

On Momoiro Island, a few of the Revolutionaries ( Ushiano,  Ahiru,  Gambo, and  Jiron) spot a ship coming to the island which is revealed to be Sabo who survived the destruction of Lulusia Kingdom due to already being on a ship along with a few others who wanted to join the Revolutionaries and was calling while sailing away before Imu destroyed the island. He refrained from calling again after fearing the Marines were still listening in on his transmission, though he had sent a coded signal to indicate he was okay. Sabo went to meet with  Ivankov and Dragon who discuss Kuma for a bit before going into what he saw at Mary Geoise.

Sabo recounts that he managed to complete their main objectives of declaring war on the World Nobles by burning their symbol, destroying Mary Geoise's food storages and rescuing Kuma. Dragon and Ivankov praised him for it since it sparked a few kingdoms to rebel against the World Government (one of which was Lulusia). However, the two also lament the loss of Cobra, who was a loved and respected ruler. Plus, that the World Government will likely unleash the  God's Knights against the Revolutionaries with Sabo as their number one target. Sabo accepts both outcomes if it can serve their cause before continuing the story.

During the  Levely, back at Mary Geoise,  Karasu (revealed to be the wielder of the  Susu Susu no Mi),  Lindbergh, and  Morley freed as many slaves as they could and kept the Admirals,  Fujitora and Ryokugyu busy, while Sabo, who went to retrieve the slave collar keys, spotted Kuma with  Saint Charlos while doing so. As that was going on, Cobra went to go talk with the World Nobles leaving Vivi to be looked after by CP0, though she refused their service after seeing their inaction to step in to save  Shirahoshi earlier from Saint Charlos. As Cobra proceeded to the Elders room,  Pell and  Chaka were refused to be allowed to come with him. Cobra dismissed them, telling the two to look after Vivi, as he was worried about what she would get into.

Sabo made his way inside Pangaea Castle and dealt with a few guards before running into Jewelry Bonney whom he knew as Kuma's daughter. Seeing that they had a common interest to save Kuma the two briefly teamed up. Sabo handed off the keys to the slave collar to Karasu and ordered him and the others to retreat once they freed the slaves, promising to be right behind them once he took care of something. Sabo and Bonney narrowly avoid a few guards, overhearing them talk about a certain room no one can enter and all who see it disappear. Once they have passed, the pair separated due to different destinations (Bonney going to Egghead while Sabo was heading for Kamabakka) though Bonney entrusted Sabo to save Kuma.

In the Empty Throne Room, Cobra met with the Five Elders, where he recounted the creation of the Celestial Dragons, the  First Twenty who moved to Mary Geoise and the vow to all rule the world equally, as well as the new royalty that took over their kingdoms in their place. However,  Arabasta's ruler,  Nefertari Lili, refrained from joining them and returned to her kingdom. However, Cobra noticed, when he was going over his kingdom's documents after the Void Century, that there was no mention of her name and that Lili never returned to Arabasta, with her younger brother ruling in her place. He questions the Elders if they knew anything of what became of her, but they state they do not since it is information from 800 years and any record since then was lost. Cobra then goes on to ask what the meaning of " D" is, as he found the name in an 800-year letter passed through Arabasta's kings.

Meanwhile, Saint Charlos once more attempted to abduct Shirahoshi, this time with the help of Kuma backing him. Her brothers rush to her aid but are stymied by the former Warlord.  Donquixote Mjosgard stops them, claiming if they attack him, that will put their kingdom in danger. Fortunately,  Sai and  Leo rush to Shirahoshi's rescue as, since they are not affiliated with any kingdom and are pirates, they do not have to worry about that stipulation. The two swiftly knocked out Charlos while Morley managed to grab Kuma and he and Karasu began their retreat. Back in the Empty Throne room, Imu decides to make their presence known, much to the Five Elders' shock that they revealed themselves and Cobra, who find them sitting on the supposed empty throne of the world.

Imu agrees to answer Cobra questions, but Cobra demands to know who they were, recognizing Imu's name in the letter as one of the first 20 kings, but Imu refuses to answer. Imu goes on to state that the people who carry the D. are those who oppose the World Government but believes those that bear the name in the modern day are unaware of the real meaning behind it. Furthermore, Lili made a mistake that resulted in the Poneglyphs being scattered across the world, causing the current pirate age.

The Elders suddenly pull out their weapons and point them at Cobra as Imu asks him the true name of the person who wrote the letter. Cobra resigns himself to his fate which he confirms when asking if would be allowed to leave if he lied but is told that his fate was seal once he saw Imu. He answers truthfully that her true name was Nefertari D. Lili. Upon hearing this, Imu sends out a dark arrow that skewers Cobra. Sabo, who was eavesdropping, suddenly attacks the Elders and Imu, but the latter manages to eat his fire. Imu and the Elders suddenly turned into monstrous forms as Sabo tries to protect Cobra, a camera Den Den Mushi catching him in the process. Sabo grabs Cobra and tries to run, with the king noting him as Luffy's brother and revealing that Luffy saved him back in Arabasta.

As they fled, Cobra requests Sabo tell Luffy and Vivi that they bear the name of D. Sabo is shocked to hear this remembering Ace likewise had the name as well back in the past when they were kids. Imu attacks again with his arrow and pierces both, somehow managing to bypass Sabo's Logia power and forcing him to drop Cobra. Cobra gets to his feet and stands in front of the monsters to give Sabo time to escape, while reciting the final lines from the letter, though it was partially drowned out by the roars of Imu and the Elders. Sabo can only watch helplessly and call out to Cobra as he is murdered in front of his eyes before being forced to flee.

After killing Cobra, one of the Five Elders sensed someone else watching and turns to a hole in a wall where Wapol witnessed the whole transaction. Realizing he saw something taboo, Wapol ran for his life using his powers make a path through the walls. Back in the council room, the other kings were told that Cobra and Wapol would not be joining them which some of the monarchs' thinking the former being satisfied with the abolishment of the Warlord system. However,  King Riku and  King Neptune sense something was wrong. Outside, Shirahoshi has been freed and she and her brothers head back to the port, although she wished to say goodbye to Vivi first.

However, in the guest room of Pangaea Castle, Vivi has been tied up and captured by CP0. She demanded answers for this action but none of them are willing to divulge, only stating once she goes missing, and she would most likely become one of the World Noble's "pets". Though they do tell her Shirahoshi is alright when she asked about her, to Vivi's great relief, as well as Leo and Sai proclamation of being part of the  Straw Hat Grand Fleet and as well as Fujitora and Ryokugyu fighting when the former helped a few freed slaves escape.

Just as Vivi started to think of a way to escape, Wapol bursts into the room in his bid to escape. Vivi seizes the chance and jumped into his mouth before CP0 realized what has happened. Realizing he is running for his life, she agrees to go with him, to the shock of Wapol's wife,  Kinderella, who thought they were eloping.

The Levely eventually came to an end; however, the delegation of Arabasta (Pell, Chaka and  Igaram) found their king and princess missing and frantically tried to search for them, unaware of Cobra's fate and that Vivi, along with Wapol, stowing away aboard a ship's hold to leave the island discreetly. Wapol contacted Morgans who agreed to pick them up in exchange for a scoop. Vivi tries to ask Wapol what he saw but he refused to tell her at that moment. Likewise, Sabo and Bonney managed to hitch their own rides out of Mary Geoise and head for their respective destinations. It would not be until later that the news broke of Cobra's death with Sabo being framed for it.

Not long after, the Elder Stars (here finally named: Saints Jaygarcia Saturn – Godhead of Science & Defense,  Marcus Mars - Godhead of Environment,  Topman Warcury – Godhead of Justice,  Ethanbaron V. Nusjuro – Godhead of Finance, and  Shepherd Ju Peter – Godhead of Agriculture) discuss what to do about Sabo, when Imu contacted them and orders them to use a weapon called the  Mother Flame, picking the Lulusia Kingdom as a target simply because it was the closest island nearby. Imu also orders Vivi be recaptured as well. Meanwhile with rebellions began in other kingdoms and the Warlord system now abolished, Seraphims of  Doflamingo, Gecko Moria and Crocodile were sent out by the Marines to quell them. In the present day, Sabo finished his story explaining that the Lulusia natives quickly overthrew their king once the ship arrived and hailed him as a hero, believing that he had killed Cobra deliberately, which inspirited them to do so. This, along with Betty's  Kobu Kobu no Mi powers, prevented him from telling them the truth. He sailed away with the people who wished to join the Revolutionaries, making his call to Dragon and Ivankov earlier, bouncing the signal from the ship back to the island and it was there that he witnessed the island getting destroyed by a mysterious object in the sky but could not tell what it was outside of being a big shadow.

Ivankov recognizes the name, "Imu", as a monarch of the  Nerona Dynasty and one of the First Twenty, theorizing that they somehow managed to find a way to extend their life. He also thought that what destroyed Lulusia could be a weapon Vegapunk created for the World Government, though Dragon suspected it may have been one of the  Ancient Weapons that they learned about from Robin during her stay with them and wondered why they would use it now, all of a sudden. Back in Mary Geoise, the citizens find themselves starving with their food supply gone (save for cake), and one of their own being executed, Mjosgard, for striking a fellow Celestial Dragon and having supported and protected the  Neptune Family, namely Shirahoshi, during the Levely. The one leading the sentence is revealed to be the Supreme Commander of the God's Knights, Saint  Figarland Garling, a former occupant of  God Valley.

#### The Next Generation of Marines: Battle on Hachinosu[]

At a shipyard near the  G-1 Marine Base,  Brannew showed  Fullbody and  Jango the "Battleship Bag", old Marine ships that he explains to the two that Garp would use to perfect his punching power and would keep the practice for decades. When pointed out that there are two, he revealed the other was for Kuzan to use and would practice along with him, with Garp establishing a rule that they cannot use Haki or Devil Fruit powers while they did so, having earned their strength over time.

Back at Hachinosu, Sanjuan Wolf was punched from the island into the ocean by Garp to the shock of the pirates that he managed to defeat him so easily. Vasco Shot attempted to use his liquor power to fire fireballs at Garp, but he blocked it by grabbing two pirates and using them as shields. The pirates realized that Garp's reputation precedes him, and that Blackbeard would kill them if Garp destroyed the island. Kujaku reported all the captives are onboard and they are set to leave. Garp ordered Koby, Grus, and Helmeppo to fall back, noting that there were indeed more pirates than they accounted for. Kuzan confronted Garp once again, stating he could not let them leave. Before they could do so, Koby heard a woman call for help, believing one of the hostages got left behind. However, Grus yelled out that it was a trap, and the "captive" was one of the female pirates. Something rushed at Koby, which Garp detected, and pushed Koby out of the way, getting stabbed in the stomach by Shiryu, who used his invisible power to sneak in close. Garp punched Shiryu point blank into the ground, but the damage had been done as he succeeded in wounding Garp.

Seeing their chance, the pirates tried to rush Garp while he is weakened, stating he has a Cross Guild bounty of three crowns which is worth 3,000,000,000. Kuzan charged in, stating to the pirates that even if Garp's hands and legs were tied, they still would not be able to kill him. As he coated his fist with ice, Kuzan reflected on their training days when he asked Garp to take him in as an apprentice. Garp refused, not wanting to be tied down training him and to get his training from the Marine instructors. Kuzan stated he already learned all he could from them and wishes to move on to the next level. Garp once more refused, but Kuzan persisted, and Garp eventually allowed Kuzan to train with him. Over the years they would punch battleships together, Kuzan slowly gaining the strength to put dents in the ships. As they got older, Garp warmed up to him, enough to complain about his family woes of Dragon becoming a revolutionary and later Luffy becoming a pirate. Eventually Kuzan became an admiral, and Garp, ironically, would visit him and have snacks even though he would be busy. In the present day, the two men hit each other with Haki powered punches and knocked each other back. Avalo Pizarro made his move, stating just because this ship is off coast, it does not mean they are safe from his Shima Shima no Mi powers. He formed arms from the rock formation and prepared to crush the ship, claiming with all the attention Blackbeard gets, he should get some recognition himself from the news with this action. Koby pleaded for him to stop, but Garp assured him everything will be alright and that "justice will prevail".

In a flashback to Koby's training days, Garp was a guest speaker in one of his classes and asks a hypothetical question about an old man and a baby who were stuck on an island full of ravenous beasts and who the cadets would save. Koby answers to just give the boat to the two and stay behind but Garp deems that wrong, saying the best answer is to just leave the old man to die and save the baby as they have a higher life expectancy. This gets him chewed out by the instructor, however, but Garp thinks the youth are full of potential. The story then goes to the present day and three weeks prior on Amazon Lily. Some of the Marines have been captured by Blackbeard and Vice Admiral Yamakaji was willing to sacrifice them to avoid any further battle with an Emperor. Koby however steps in and offers himself up in exchange for the officers which Blackbeard accepted.

In the present day, Pizarro is about to bring his island hand down on the ship. The Marines onboard are about to abandon ship to save the citizens. Back on the island, Koby asks Garp what they can do, to which Garp tells them they were going to stop the hand much to Grus, Helmeppo, and Koby's shock. He quickly lays out the plan: He would give them an opening, Helmeppo will cover Grus and Koby, Koby will destroy the hand and Grus will catch the debris that follows. Before Koby can question it, Garp orders the three to go and the trio reluctantly do so. Grus ask Koby if he has a bomb on him, but Koby states he does not. Helmeppo manages to deflect some cannon shots at the two while Garp, though wounded, manages to get to his feet and, to Kuzan's surprise, suddenly zips at him, knocking him down. Then jumping from the buildings to the skull rock formation, hitting it with a . Since Pizzaro's fruit is synchronized with him, his real body takes damage as well and he was stunned. Koby cites that as the signal for his role, Grus ask what he plans to do and Koby can only answer to live up to Garp's expectations.

After doing his attack, Garp thinks back to two years ago and to Koby's training, questioning Helmeppo about Koby's injuries. Helmeppo reveals that, despite Garp's rigorous training, that Koby still does not feel strong enough and needs to put in more effort. So, every night he would sneak away and punch the battleship bags even at the expense of himself. Back in the present, Koby jumps to the hand as Pizarro starts to bring the island hand down on the Marine ship. With the Marines and civilians panicking and the pirates jeering and mocking him, Koby winds up and punches at the fist with his own . This destroys the island hand and arm completely and severely injures Pizarro in the process much to the awe of everyone watching as Garp laughs in amusement. Helmeppo catches Koby while Grus uses his clay powers to shield the ship from the falling rocks, before all three lands on the ship. Tashigi calls for Garp to join them, but he tells them to go on without him. Assuring the Marines onboard that he would figure out a way on his own despite Koby wanting to turn back for him.

As he is surrounded by pirates, including the Blackbeard officers, and Kuzan freezes him with an ice spear (similar to what happened with Saul), Garp tells them that they all are the future of the Marines. The following day, headlines in the News Coo would tell of the safe return of Koby and the disappearance of Vice Admiral Garp on Hachinosu as well as an incident occurring on Egghead caused by Monkey D. Luffy, one of the new Emperors of the Sea, barricading himself at Egghead Island, as Kizaru's fleet have now arrived at the island.

#### The Siege of Egghead: The World Government's Ultimate Forces[]

Meanwhile at  Foosha Village, the news of Garp's capture has reached the island. Mayor  Woop Slap is not concerned, figuring Garp will be alright.  Makino's son seems to have taken a liking to Luffy just from his picture alone. While in the mountains,  Dadan is worried for Garp and Luffy. Suddenly, a massive earthquake is felt around the seas as an after effect of Lulusia's destruction six days prior, a Marine ship sent out to check out the remains only finding a hole in the ocean the seas are pouring into. No one (save for Imu) are aware of this as the seas rise one meter as a result, with a few islands being sunk and forcing several residents to evacuate their homes while others look on worried as they see the seas become choppy.

Back on Egghead, a day has passed since Kizaru's fleet arrived and now wait outside the island with nine Vice Admirals on standby. The Admiral is forced to destroy one of the Sea Beasts that attacks them, much to Sentomaru's anger. He calls Kizaru, trying to disway him from carrying out his orders in the name of their friendship, but the Admiral refuses to budge since they were orders from the top, though cites he is not happy about it. As they argue, Jaygarcia Saturn talks with  Doberman, ordering that his presence not be revealed. He was briefed on what the Marines know so far: The Straw Hats, Vegapunk, the Satellites, the Seraphim, and CP0 being in the lab; the other Cipher Pol agents being kept captive thinking that Sentomaru was guarding them with the Pacifistas; and the barrier keeping anyone from getting in or out. When informed that the residents evacuated, Saturn orders them to be hunted and their ships sunk for fear that they may know something about the Void Century. He likewise dismisses concern over Jewelry Bonney, apparently not seeing her as a threat.

A call is suddenly made to the Elder Stars which the Marines listen into via the Black Den Den Mushi Kizaru has on him. It is then revealed that York is the one who chastises the Elder Stars for coming to kill her along with the other targets despite the deal she made with them, citing if she knew about the Void Century, she would not have told them in the first place. When asked about the Straw Hats and CP0, York claims her calling should be proof she took care of them.

The Elder Stars get to business and ask if she can make another Mother Flame for them which she agrees to on the condition that they do not harm her, the lab (as it has the power plant needed to make the weapons) and to stick to their deal to make her a Celestial Dragon. They agree before she adds one more request: That they save her from the Straw Hats.

Inside, York has been defeated, chained down and surrounded by the Straw Hats, Bonney, Vegapunk and Lucci with Zoro holding her at blade point while Usopp holds up the Den Den Mushi for her to make the call. The entire group heard everything and now know the context of the situation as York whines for the Elder Stars to beat them for her.

To the surprise of everyone, Luffy then picks up the call, introducing himself to the Five Elders while simultaneously confirming that he and his crew are allies of Dr. Vegapunk, and tells the Elders that if they care for York's safety, they should call off their fleet. Mars then asks Luffy who else is with him, but before he can reveal any more information, the call is ended by Robin, who angrily retorts at Luffy, telling him they cannot give their enemy too much information to which Luffy apologizes, asking if they will back down, but Usopp only tells him that this would be a dream.

Saturn, having followed the call, then reaffirmed the three main objectives which the fleet needs to save: York, Punk Records and the Power Source which could fuel the Mother Flame, deeming anything below that expendable, even concerns by his underlining Doberman, who pointed out that several of their Cipher Pol Agents were still on the island, but Saturn dismissed the concerns, stating their lives would not matter if they achieved their goals, as they could be simply replaced. While waiting outside, Saturn then received the information gathered by Rob Lucci, discussing what he had learned with Kizaru. Saturn asked Kizaru if he was able to bypass the Frontier Dome's Defense System with his Devil Fruit Powers, which Kizaru confirmed but told Saturn that Sentomaru was guarding it. To Saturn's suggestion to ignore Sentomaru anyways, Kizaru replied he could not do that since it would go against his own ideals, in addition, Sentomaru would also deploy both the Sea Beast Weapons and Pacifista to attack the fleet should they start their assault. Saturn then asked about the Power Source for the Mother Flame and Kizaru confirmed Lucci was able to relay the information to them, which then led to the fleet getting into battle position, with the soldiers being told to engage the Sea Beast Weapons in combat and the  Rokushiki users being put on standby. Outside the island, the Marine fleet was then caught in heavy fights with both the Pacifista, which had just received their orders from Sentomaru, and the Sea Beast Weapons, which caused some of the Vice Admirals to spring into action and engage the Sea Beast Weapons directly.

Inside the Labophase, York then told everybody any hurt to her would result in the destruction of Egghead similarly to Ohara, which only had her being smacked by Nami. Everybody was then recovering from the previous endurances, with Robin being tended to by Chopper and Kaku resting trying to recover as well. Luffy and Bonney were eating while Usopp tried to make contact to the underground basement but could not concentrate due to Lilith mourning Shaka's and Pythagoras's deaths at York's hand, with Lucci noting their demises as well as Edison, Atlas and Lilith being injured but simply stated he was talking to himself when asked by Kaku what he was doing. Usopp successfully made contact with the captured Cipher Pol agents, asking them if they were okay as they had been provided with food previously. When they asked to be freed, Usopp denied them that, but they then asked if they could be moved to a different place instead as they had been imprisoned alongside the Seraphim, who were successfully contained in bubbles, which had the same property as Seastone and which were also utilized by the Pacifista Mark III. Replying to the Agents' fears, S-Snake told them they had no orders to kill them, so they would have no reason to be afraid of them.

Franky then talked to S-Snake, thanking her for unpetrifying him, Lilith and Usopp earlier, with Dr. Vegapunk wondering if that was a side effect of the Lineage Factor. As it turned out, Luffy crossed path with S-Snake earlier, mistaking her for Boa Hancock and asking her to free his friends, which she did as she inherited Hancock's love and affection for Luffy, something Vegapunk did not know but made note of, with Luffy once again thanking her, though she mistook it for affection once again. Atlas then told Vegapunk that she still could not open the Frontier Dome, as York then revealed she had sealed the Frontier Dome and locked everything else with a special password only she knew and would not share with the rest of the Vegapunks. When Dr. Vegapunk was informed by Stussy that Egghead was completely surrounded, Vegapunk then told Nami they should head in one direction her Log Pose recorded in Wano, with one needle pointing northeast of Egghead, which Vegapunk confirmed was leading to Elbaf, which then sent Luffy and Usopp into joy. Vegapunk then devised a plan alongside Franky on how to escape from Egghead, as the island was completely surrounded by Marine Ships and the only way would be by using the Vegaforce-01 carrying the Thousand Sunny northeast of the island. However, due to the Vegaforce-01's limitations of having to be inside the airfield of Egghead, the Thousand Sunny would then have to escape on its own, which Franky confirmed was possible due to the , intriguing Vegapunk.

Atlas, however, admitted while the plan was good, they still had to crack the password for the Frontier Dome to be unsealed, as York assured them she would not tell them the password under any circumstance, but Vegapunk, Atlas and Edison came up to the challenge of cracking it together. Lilith, meanwhile, was tasked by Vegapunk to bring the Vegaforce-01 in position, as she was joined by Luffy, Franky and Bonney who were all making their way towards the Thousand Sunny and Vegaforce-01. While Lilith got excited about leaving Egghead after having been stuck there for so long, Bonney then shared the sentiment, stating she would miss the food, but Luffy replied to Sanji could make some for them, to which Bonney reacted with joy. Upon Luffy's pondering as to why she was in such a happy mood out of the sudden, she replied she no longer held any grudge against Vegapunk, with Luffy saying he was glad she was not crying anymore, to which she angrily replied she did not cry. Luffy's group then reached the Vegaforce-01 and the Thousand Sunny just as Kizaru used  to reach the island. Just as Sentomaru had anticipated Kizaru to come to the island, he engaged Kizaru in battle while Luffy sensed someone strong coming.

Dr. Vegapunk, upon hearing the Pacifista attack, then wondered as to why they would attack, but the Straw Hats soon realized Kizaru had been sent to take Sentomaru out, which caused Vegapunk to apologize to Sentomaru for having to face someone so strong and it would be okay if Sentomaru wanted to flee. Sentomaru, though, was heavily engaged in a fight with Kizaru, in which Kizaru used  to fire several light beams at Sentomaru, during which Kizaru tried to persuade Sentomaru to surrender but as he ran, Sentomaru once again strengthened his resolve to protect Vegapunk as he gave the Straw Hats his word. He then grabbed his axe, jumping into the air, slashing Kizaru vertically, but Kizaru only turned into light, evading the attack and upon Kizaru's inquiry as to when he became friends with pirates, he affirmed he would side with anyone who would protect Vegapunk. During the fight, both remembered their first meeting decades ago, back when Borsalino and Vegapunk met a young Sentomaru who had just beaten up some bears which the two were tasked of dealing with. Borsalino then realized Sentomaru was kicked out of his village, to which Sentomaru replied he would need a job which could pay him enough to buy as many Onigiri as he wanted, to which Vegapunk asked him if he wanted to be his bodyguard, which Sentomaru gleefully accepted.

After remembering their past, Kizaru commented on how cute Sentomaru was back then and that he taught him as much as he could so Sentomaru could fight, just as Sentomaru attacked him with , which was not very effective, as Kizaru simply blocked the attacked and blasted Sentomaru to the ground with a laser beam, defeating him. Kizaru then picked up the Command Chip Sentomaru carried and ordered the Pacifista to stand down their assault, instead to aim for the Sea Beast Weapons.

On the Labophase, Sentomaru's defeat was witnessed by everyone present, but Atlas, Dr. Vegapunk and Edison were still focused on cracking the password to unseal the Frontier Dome. Dr. Vegapunk then revealed to the Straw Hats, that Kizaru would have no problems slipping past the Frontier Dome as his body was made out of light, just as Kizaru happened to appear inside the Labophase. His presence, however, caused the emergency system to react, alerting Luffy's group and just as the Straw Hats tried to warn Luffy to speed up, Lucci, out of a sudden, tried to stab Vegapunk, who was unaware of the attack, but Stussy instead throws herself between Lucci and Vegapunk, acting as human shield, taking the blow instead. As Stussy collapsed to the ground, Sanji grabbed a bubble gum, concealing Kaku inside a bubble just when Lucci's next attack was blocked by Zoro, who pushes Lucci and himself outside, stating Lucci should not underestimate his opponents.

Meanwhile, in Mary Geoise, Bartholomew Kuma unleashed a rampage, as the soldiers were unable to contain him, and he caused severe damage to the environment with his . This led to Sakazuki to step in and confront him, all while some World Nobles were complaining about the lack of food, demanding Sakazuki to execute Kuma for injuring them during his rampage. Sakazuki told Kuma he would have to kill him if he did not let the World Government control him anymore, attacking him with , destroying a portion of Kuma's face. Kuma then started running, but Sakazuki managed to blast off parts of Kuma's legs with his magma shots but was yet unable to prevent Kuma from escaping Mary Geoise. Sakazuki then remembered the time he captured Jewelry Bonney two years ago, telling her father willingly offered to become a weapon, but Bonney refused to believe it at that time. He continued to wonder where Kuma was headed, even when the World Nobles were yelling at him in the background, but he ignored it.

As Kizaru landed on the Labophase, he spotted the Vegaforce-01 but was then immediately kicked by Luffy, blocking his attack. Luffy then confidently stated that both he and his crew were now a hundred times stronger than two years ago in  Sabaody, with Luffy then activating , barraging Kizaru with a flurry of fist attacks who blocks every single one, though Kizaru admitted Luffy had become a formidable opponent since he defeated Kaidou in Wano. Kizaru then wanted to know from Luffy why he protected Dr. Vegapunk, but Luffy counter asked Kizaru why he wanted to kill Vegapunk, to which Kizaru only admitted that from a personal point, he did not want to kill Vegapunk because he had known him for a long time, but he did not have much of a choice. Kizaru then flew away to gain momentum for a kick attack, speeding back to Luffy with light speed, kicking him with extreme force, which was enough to send Luffy flying across the Labophase, destroying the Vegaforce-01 in the process and sending Luffy into the Frontier Dome's barrier.

Due to this, the Thousand Sunny then fell out of the Vegaforce-01's robot hand, leading to Franky, Bonney and Lilith running away from the incoming explosion. Kizaru then turned his attention towards them, commenting on how much Bonney had grown, asking her why she was getting in his way of killing Dr. Vegapunk, who she was supposed to hate. Bonney only grabbed a tire, using  on Kizaru, declaring her target had shifted. Kizaru easily dodged her attack while asking her to not make him hurt any more of his associates, kicking her into the barrier as well, then disappearing just as Franky was about to charge up a . Franky then realized where Kizaru had to go and contacted Usopp to warn him, just as Dr. Vegapunk, Edison and Atlas managed to crack the password which sealed the Frontier Dome. Just as Dr. Vegapunk asked Franky if the Vegaforce-01 and Thousand Sunny had been brought to the side of the island, Kizaru appeared inside the lab, telling them their plan had been foiled, telling Vegapunk this mission was tough on Kizaru already so he did not want to drag it out, when suddenly Luffy reappeared, activating  and using  to grab Kizaru with his hand, just as the sound of his heartbeat seemed to reached down to the Fabriophase, activating the Iron Giant in response to Luffy's transformation. Kizaru, who was still being held by Luffy, then got swung around by Luffy and eventually thrown away from the Control Tower. With this short moment, Atlas decided to go to the Fabriophase to manually overwrite the Pacifista's command and she was aided by Dr. Vegapunk in her attempt under the protest of Usopp, but Vegapunk contacted Franky, asking if Bonney was safe with Franky confirming but that she landed on the Fabriophase. Sanji then offered to join the two in their endeavor while Jinbe gathered luggage for Vegapunk.

On the Fabriophase, a bruised Bonney was then using her Devil Fruit powers on several Marines, incapacitating them by changing their age. As she hid, she remembered how Sentomaru saved her when she was kicked off the Laborphase by Kizaru. On the Labophase, Luffy observed Zoro still fighting Lucci, offering him to aid him, but Zoro rejected the offer, telling Luffy to concentrate on Kizaru while he took care of Lucci, mocking the latter that his power was certainly not enough to beat Luffy anymore to which Lucci only replied it would be enough to at least kill Luffy's "No. 2".

Outside Egghead, Kizaru managed to avoid falling into the sea by using , returning to the island at lightspeed. Once he caught up to Luffy, he turned the individual light parts into copies of himself, with every copy using  to create light swords with which they attempted to attack Luffy, though the damage was only minor cuts. He responded to the attack with , destroying a few before running. This, however, was a trick by Luffy, using this to make the copies getting into a row, using  to destroy them all out at once. Luffy realized though too late that Kizaru had used all the copies to distract Luffy long enough to subdue Usopp inside the Control Tower. Kizaru then realized that Vegapunk was no longer inside the Control Tower, with the latter being in a vehicle, called the Vegatank-08 together with Atlas, with both Franky and Sanji hanging onto the vehicle from the outside. Kizaru then spotted them, trying to blast them, but Luffy stepped in front, taking the laser beam. Both Kizaru and Luffy then start fighting each other again when they, alongside Zoro, Lucci and Jinbe, get an  uneasy feeling.

On the coast, the Marines were informed that Vegapunk had left the Labophase, as Edison partially disabled the Frontier Dome so Vegapunk could descend onto the Fabriophase. Atlas then issued a new command to the Pacifista, ordering them to annihilate every Marine on the island, which they immediately do just as Vegapunk's groups makes their way down towards the Fabriophase just as Sanji detects Bonney's presence. Bonney, meanwhile, is being attacked by a Vice Admiral, just as she pulls a gun and uses  on some Marines, who are then knocked out by the attack. Bonney then attempts to run just as her attempt was prevented by another Vice Admiral named  Bluegrass, who used her  Devil Fruit powers to control a Mark III. Pacifista, ordering it to shoot at Bonney. Bonney, however, is then saved by Sanji, with both dodging an incoming attack from a Vice Admiral and Sanji getting her to the Vegatank-08.

Saturn then orders the Pacifista to stop their attacks, just when a magic circle appears to be forming on the ground in the middle of the Fabriophase, as all Marines are informed that Saturn has arrived on Egghead, leaving everyone in total shock of the presence of one of the Five Elders. An order is then given to all lower-ranking officers, commodores and below, to not directly look at Saturn as he appears out of the circle, having transformed into a large demonic spider hybrid: as one of the Marine soldiers accidentally looks at him, Saturn makes his head telekinetically exploding. Due to Saturn's arrival, Sanji's group got distracted, which then gave Kizaru an opening to destroy the cloud road they were riding on which causes them to fall. Luffy then catches up to Kizaru and uses , hitting him in the side of his head. However, Luffy also reached his form's limit, changing back to normal as he fell to the ground in a nearly unconscious state. In addition, the Vegaforce-08 also falls on the ground, completely destroyed but everybody else not hurt.

Unfortunately, everyone is then confronted by Saturn, who recognized Vegapunk, stating his dissatisfaction with Vegapunk still being alive. Bonney then becomes extremely enraged, picking up a katana which is close by, as she remembers a conversation about her father, tearfully stabbing Saturn in the chest with the katana, which leads to some Marine soldiers and Vice Admirals to be worried about Saturn potentially being seriously injured, however, he brushes that off, stating had the blown been fatal, he would have dodged it. Saturn then forces Bonney off him by emitting an aura from his eyes and grabbing her, which he then follows up by doing the same to Sanji who comes to Bonney's help but is hit hard by the attack and falls to the ground. Saturn then removes the blade out of his chest, with the wound healing immediately, causing shock and confusion by Franky. Due to the confusion, some Marines try to take advantage of the situation and capture Dr Vegapunk, but Saturn orders them to stand down, stating they would have nowhere to run while turning his attention towards Kizaru, who is lying on the ground due to Luffy's attack, stating he would not recover for a while. Saturn then turned his attention towards Luffy, trying to stab him with one of his legs, but Franky prevents that, using  to punch Luffy away and then grabs Luffy afterwards, proudly proclaiming Luffy has become troublesome enough for not even the highest authority to even ignore him anymore. Saturn then acknowledged that both Luffy's and Bonney's presence on Egghead was unforeseen, but that the island was surrounded by the Marines, and they could not escape, though he would like to see them try before telling Dr. Vegapunk he was disappointed about his "betrayal" but thanked him for all his contributions. After telling them he would like them to die in the most painful way, he tightened his grip on Bonney while simultaneously keeping Sanji, Vegapunk and Franky forced on the ground due to a mysterious aura, which Vegapunk suspects must come from a Devil Fruit power.

Bonney angrily stares at Saturn, telling him he killed her father, to which Saturn reveals Kuma was born a slave, a remnant of the  Buccaneer Tribe, who committed a grave crime in the past, which caused them to go extinct, making Kuma the sole survivor. He then holds up Bonney, ordering the Marines to aim for her head with Sanji and Vegapunk calling him to stop. Bonney then remembers the time when Kuma told her a long time ago, he wanted to be a hero who would save people from suffering, just like Nika, with Bonney asking him if Nika would set her free to, with Kuma confirming it.

#### Hands of Liberation: The Life and Times of Bartholomew Kuma[]

47 years ago, Kuma was born in the Sorbet Kingdom to a Buccaneer man,  Clapp, and his human wife, but despise Clapp's wishes, Kuma's blood information got leaked to the World Government, who immediately captures the family and enslaves them to the World Nobles. Kuma then ended up as a slave to a World Noble, who had him work to the bone every day and physically beating him. One day, Kuma's father told Kuma that his mother had died, with Kuma suffering a complete breakdown, but his father tells him that he has to endure as the Warrior of Liberation, Nika, will one day save him, just as his father starts dancing and singing in the rhythm of Nika's heartbeat to cheer him up, but he is shot and killed by a World Noble for being too loud.

Fast forward, several years later in the  West Blue, the World Nobles organize a tournament, the  Native Hunting Competition, where they eradicate an entire population, and which also takes place every three years. The site of that year's tournament was  God Valley, which was unaffiliated with the World Government and was resented by the World Nobles due to its name feeling blasphemous to the World Nobles. Their goal for the tournament was to kill all the people on the island, as well as some troublesome slaves and then claim the island and all its rich resources in the name of the World Government. When the king heard about the government, he objected but was quickly slain by a young Figarland Garling (who in return suffered a massive deduction, but was not upset about it since it would give the other contestants a good handicap).

Saturn himself was present during the event on God Valley and was informed that Kuma was recaptured after having attempted to escape. The ones who did it, however, were other slaves who did not want him to run away as they would be killed for that as well. They were then stopped by two other slaves: a young Emporio Ivankov and  Ginny. Ivankov spotted Kuma and said he heard the Buccaneers shared Giant blood, when he then proclaimed he would live on and asked Kuma if he wanted the same.

With one hour before the start of the competition, the World Nobles began to prepare while the people started to run and hide. At Marine Headquarters,  Kong contacted Garp, who was on vacation, and advised him to head to God Valley as the Rocks Pirates were going there to retrieve the "treasure" that the World Nobles stole from Hachinosu. Garp initially did not care, saying that the Nobles should have known better, but then he decided to go after hearing that Roger would be there, too.

The competition started, with the World Nobles taking down the civilians one by one. Ivankov started rallying the people by saying that nobody would be alive by the end of the competition, and that they would have to try escaping now. When someone said they would be freed in three weeks if they survived, Ivankov told him to stop dreaming and said that every previous competition ended with zero survivors. He revealed it is just a lie meant to motivate them into clinging onto their survival in order to make killing them more satisfying, and that they must escape the game itself to live. After Ivankov's chains were broken off by a shark fish-man, Ginny informed everyone of two of the competition's prizes: the Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu and the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi. Ivankov noted that if they could get past the Marine blockade and steal those Devil Fruits, they could escape. Ginny assured the plan would succeed since two weeks ago, she leaked the event outside the island, hopeful that someone would hear it and arrive. Kuma then volunteered to be a decoy, as his strong physique would help him survive longer.

Just then, multiple pirate ships of the Rocks Pirates made it to God Valley, catching the Marines off guard.  Rocks then ordered his crew to follow him as they made landfall. Just as the  Roger Pirates also arrived, Garling ordered the Marines to guard the World Nobles while the God's Knights fend off the pirates. The Marines led by Garp appeared as backup, resulting in an all-out conflict. In the midst of the chaos, Ivankov and Kuma managed to steal the Devil Fruits and prepared to eat them. Before Ivankov could eat his fruit, he was attacked by  Charlotte Linlin, who stole it from him. She attempted to take Kuma's fruit as well, but he ate it just in time. Saturn confronted him, saying that as a buccaneer, Kuma was meant to be either enslaved or dead. Kuma questioned how someone could be born less important than others, and with his power, he wanted to liberate as many slaves as he could just like Nika, with Saturn saying that is why his people should be erased. At some point afterwards, Kuma used his ability to rescue over 500 people, including Ivankov and Ginny. The three then went to the Sorbet Kingdom.

In Sorbet, Ivankov read the news about the incident, in which it brought fame to Garp as a hero while most of the other events were covered up by Morgans. At Kuma's family's church, Kuma prayed for all the lives that were lost in the incident, but Ivankov and Ginny remarked that his actions have brought freedom and joy to many people, and he now has the "Hands of Liberation". Kuma and Ginny then chose to stay in Sorbet while Ivankov went out to sea. The two would then live together and chop wood to sell for money. They came across two boys who bullied Kuma as they thought he was lying about being nine years old. After they were beaten up by Ginny and Kuma took away their pain, they became friends. At the church, they ate together and expressed how happy they were now that they were free.

Eight years later, Kuma worked as a pastor at the church transferring citizens' pain to himself every Sunday. While the citizens were happily grateful to him and Kuma was glad to help, Ginny grew irritated with them as they were asking for his services more frequently without paying in return. The citizens explained that since the new king  Bekori had taken the throne, they could not afford to keep themselves healthy since they needed to pay the  Heavenly Tribute, or they would be imprisoned. One night, Kuma absorbed a lot of pain, needing to be treated by Ginny. Ginny felt sorry for Kuma as the elders had no idea how much he was suffering for them, but Kuma said that the pain would return to them if he did not take it in, and he was pleased that he could help them. Five years later, Ginny proposed to Kuma, but he refused as he did not want his Buccaneer heritage to put her in danger like his mother. They also read about the actions of the Freedom Fighters, where Kuma said he would want to help others just like Dragon.

Three years later in the Castle Town, the royal army was enslaving citizens from the south region of Sorbet, per a new law established. Kuma raised a protest against this and attacked the army, being labeled as a traitor and imprisoned afterwards. Ginny and several others who demanded for his release were sent to prison as well. Bekori then declared that only the north region would be the actual Sorbet Kingdom while the south region with the citizens unable to pay the Heavenly Tribute would be cut off as a lawless area. In prison, Kuma grew worried that Sorbet was going into a dangerous direction, but Ginny informed him that Bekori was a servant of the World Nobles, and fighting against him would mean fighting against the World Government.

Soon, the Freedom Fighters invaded Sorbet, prompting Bekori to redact the enslavement policy, to which the citizens rejoiced. Two of the Freedom Fighters came to the prison and freed everyone, who Kuma and Ginny recognized as Dragon and Ivankov. Afterwards, the two accepted their offer to join the Freedom Fighters, which evolved into the Revolutionary Army. While the army was low on funds, they went in as mercenaries aiding rebellions into overthrowing their rulers. Dragon also offered to teach anyone joining the army on how to wield weapons. Kuma asked how he learned to use weapons, and Dragon said he used to be a Marine but defected since he did not find any justice there. Once in a while, Kuma would also visit Sorbet to check on the south's citizens.

Eight years later, the Revolutionary Army's East Army and its commander Ginny had planned to meet up with Kuma's group the next day. However, they were then hit by a surprise attack and reported to Dragon that Ginny had been captured in the process.

About two years later after the Revolutionary Army had rescued those from the  Goa Kingdom, they were asked to send reinforcements for the rebellion in  Tumi. Kuma offered to head there, but Ivankov suggested him not to as he had been acting more reckless than before. As the rebellion succeeded in taking down Tumi's armed forces, Kuma thought about when Ginny was captured, in which she was forcibly taken as a wife to a World Noble. Eventually, Ginny contacted the Revolutionaries and said she had gotten sick and been brought back to the lower world. Kuma asked where she was, but she told Kuma not to look for her as she was dying. She concluded the call by asking Dragon and Ivankov to take care of Kuma, and that she would always love him. Kuma knew where she would be and teleported to Sorbet, but found her dead with a baby she brought along. The citizens said her skin grew blue, hard stones after being exposed to natural light, and she had made it safely with her daughter, Bonney. After mourning Ginny's death, Kuma swore he would raise her daughter.

Kuma and the elders would raise Bonney together. They noted Bonney had inherited her mother's appetite and soon she had come to accept Kuma as her father, much to his joy. Around this time, he would also join the Revolutionary Army on missions while taking care of her. One day, Kuma ordered for the church windows to be sealed, as Bonney started to develop the same stones on her skin as the ones that killed Ginny. Kuma tried calling the kingdom's doctors over to check what it was, but they had no knowledge of it. Kuma then informed the Revolutionary Army of the situation and resigned so he could look after Bonney, to which Dragon accepted and said they would ask every doctor they could find about the disease. Bonney would be bullied for the stones on her face, but Kuma cheered her up by saying they made her look beautiful. She also told him about how the various places she would like to travel to after her disease was cured.

One day, a doctor visited Kuma and told him Bonney had the rare, incurable disease  Sapphire Scales. He said that even with all-natural light blocked off, Bonney had until age ten at the latest to live. Bonney had overheard this conversation but mistook "age ten" as when she would be better. Kuma chose to tell her so, horrified of what will actually happen.

One year later, the citizens had informed Kuma that Bekori returned causing trouble and planned to burn all of the deadweight people and their homes to the ground. Bekori was hopeful that this plan would eradicate the kingdom's "filth" as it succeeded in the Goa Kingdom and received praise from the World Nobles. The people opposed this idea, but Bekori ordered to kill them as retribution. Kuma then confronted Bekori and used his Devil Fruit power to defeat his forces and destroy the palace despite the consequences of deposing him, ending in Bekori being dethroned in an incident known as the " Solo Revolution".

The citizens then wanted Kuma to succeed Bekori as king of Sorbet. But as he was hailed as the king, he posed as a figurehead to the real king  Bulldog, who ruled Sorbet before Bekori and was well respected by the citizens. Suddenly, a girl ran around the church, and everyone was shocked that it was Bonney, having eaten a  Devil Fruit at one point that changes her appearance by age. Shortly after, Bulldog and the queen dowager  Conney visited the church to tell Kuma that the World Government has framed him as a dictator that seized the throne with violence, presumably as part of Bekori's attempt to take back his status as king. Kuma then decided to entrust Bonney and the throne to Bulldog before he left to drive Bekori's threat away from Sorbet.

At sea, Kuma encountered Bekori who led a Marine fleet to try and kill him, but Kuma managed to sink all the ships, resulting in him being assigned a bounty. Kuma would later visit many islands to ask the residents if they knew a cure for Sapphire Scales, to no success. He also came across the Revolutionary Army again, where he spoke with Dragon about what has happened since he left. Per Kuma's blessing,  Belo Betty gained the role as commander of the East Army after Ginny's death left the position vacant for years. Dragon also told Kuma about the scientist Dr. Vegapunk and that he was transferring to a new lab after the incident at Punk Hazard, in which Kuma could ask him about curing Bonney's disease. Kuma thanked Dragon for this opportunity and said he would return to the Revolutionary Army after it is done.

After Kuma returned to Sorbet for Bonney, they both traveled to the Marines Science Division: Lab 8, later known as Egghead, where they met Vegapunk. Vegapunk was amazed by his physique and assured him that Bonney would survive. Upon learning that Kuma was a Buccaneer, Vegapunk requested to use Kuma's blood to clone him into soldiers in return for covering the costs of Bonney's treatment. Kuma asked what the clones would be used for, to which Vegapunk convinced him that they would be used in the Marines to save people's lives. Even though Dragon would not approve of this arrangement, Kuma agreed to Vegapunk's terms, grateful that Bonney could be saved.

At Mary Geoise, Saturn voiced his disappointment with Vegapunk for not taking full advantage of the project. After saying soldiers are valuable by how many people that are capable of killing, he revealed he would put his own agenda in effect. Just then, a group of Marines led by Kizaru had arrived at the lab as the Admiral revealed to Vegapunk that there was a Surveillance Den Den Mushi watching him and that there could not be any deals made with pirates in secret. Saturn contacted Vegapunk via Den Den Mushi to say it would be impractical to have a pirate like Kuma as the face of the Pacifista project, thus he asked some additional conditions of Kuma before Bonney's treatment would be approved.

The first was for Kuma to join the Seven Warlords of the Sea, as the pirate Ace had defeated one of the members without anyone to be a replacement, and Kuma would represent the Seven Warlords well with his pirate status. The second condition was for Kuma himself to become modified into a human weapon to aid the Marines against other pirates, due to his previous history with the Revolutionary Army so he does not turn against the World Government. The last was for Kuma to be stripped of his free will and individuality. Vegapunk was angry with this request as he would essentially die and become a heartless robot, but Saturn said he was in no position to argue and that it was needed to compensate for the massive funds used just on a single girl's treatment. To Vegapunk's shock, Kuma tearfully agreed to Saturn's demands as the opportunity to have Bonney cured finally presented itself. Vegapunk then told Saturn that Kuma's modifications would take two years while Bonney's treatment would take six months in addition to another year before she could go outside, which had Kuma relieved that she would be better by age ten. Saturn had also said that until Kuma's augmentation was complete, the World Government would be keeping Bonney as a hostage to ensure he did not defy any orders, which had Vegapunk upset as it meant that Kuma and Bonney would not see each other again. Kuma accepted this but asked that after her treatment, Bonney would be held in the Sorbet Kingdom church where she grew up, while never being informed about her disease or her status as a hostage. Saturn was willing to grant this request as it did not matter where she stayed. For the next six months, Kuma and Bonney stayed at the lab together as they underwent their procedures and grew closer to Vegapunk, Sentomaru, and Kizaru. Around this time, construction of the lab also started advancing towards its future appearance as Egghead.

After six months had passed, Bonney's treatment was completed, and she went to Sorbet with Kuma where the citizens and Conney welcomed them back and said they would take care of her. Kuma then told Bonney that since he was a pirate, he could not stay in the country and would return next year, while in the meantime he would write many letters to her. Just then, they were greeted by a group of Cipher Pol agents posing as doctors. The leading  CP8 agent as a nurse  Alpha claimed they would watch over Bonney until she recovered from the disease. Though she acted nice towards Bonney, she set up protection around the church to prevent strangers without identification from entering, while she reminded Kuma that Bonney was now a captive of the government. Lastly, Kuma thanked Bonney for being born as he bid everyone farewell.

After Kuma had left, the news about his Warlord title had reached the other Warlords and the Revolutionary Army, the latter of which was shocked that Kuma became a subordinate of the government. At sea, Kuma wrote letters to Bonney as he travelled alone to find places for both of them to visit. He soon arrived near Foosha Village where he was given a new order from the government.

Kuma went to  Mt. Colubo, where he saw Luffy training and thought back to a previous conversation he had with Dragon. Kuma noticed that Dragon was particularly familiar with Dawn Island and a boy that lived there at a distant village. However, Dragon said he may as well die if he kept talking with Kuma about it because he believes a child is their parent's weak spot. Kuma then understood what Dragon meant and decided to stop discussing it. While training, Luffy was amazed by his new attack and named it , to which he could use against a formidable enemy when he would become a pirate and have a crew to protect. Kuma's Den Den Mushi started ringing as he teleported away before Luffy could spot him.

The government had given Kuma an order to eliminate a group of pirates that had pillaged a merchant ship. Instead, Kuma chose to check on the merchants and escort those injured to a hospital before returning to have the pirates give back what they stole. He continued writing letters to Bonney.

At the church, Bonney continuously checked the mail for letters from her father, but none had arrived. Gyogyo thought that Kuma was busy or the News Coos were delivering to the wrong places, while Conney was hopeful that the letters would soon arrive. The truth was that Alpha had been intercepting and ripping every letter before they made it inside the church. One day, Alpha came inside to give Bonney medicine and noticed that she briefly looked bigger than normal after she and Gyogyo fought but could not figure out why. She gave Bonney medicine (really just bitter syrup) as Conney told Gyogyo that Bonney's powers were to be kept secret just in case.

At Lab 08, construction had been completed and Vegapunk had his head removed with the last step left to lift the lab and brain above. Stussy commented his new appearance suited him. She noticed Kuma was going to have his free will removed and wondered if it was worse that she had free will as a clone or that a true person like Kuma had none, but Vegapunk said she was also a real person. Kuma asked what would happen to him once he had his free will removed, where Vegapunk answered that he would obey every order from above and lose his memories and personality. Vegapunk also ensured Kuma would maintain some free will until the procedure finished, which would be in one more year. Hearing this, Kuma chose to write letters to Bonney with as much thought as possible beforehand.

At the church, Conney and the citizens celebrated Bonney's ninth birthday. Around that time at night, Bonney checked the mail but once again found no letters and grew worried that Kuma had forgotten to write letters to her like he said. Six months later, Kuma continued aiding the Revolutionary Army during missions but leaving without saying anything, which Dragon suspected was for reasons that could not be told. Around this time, Bonney's Sapphire Scales disease had been fully cured and she wanted to go outside, but Alpha said she still had to be cared for until her tenth birthday, going against what Vegapunk had estimated.

Bonney soon found out from Conney that Alpha and her group were secretly Cipher Pol agents, and they accidentally revealed that Bonney's disease was already cured while they had drinks. Based on this, Conney deduced that they would not let her go and that they must be why Kuma's letters never arrived. She then urged Bonney to set sail with Gyogyo and the others so she could find Kuma. Bonney used her Devil Fruit power to appear as Conney and sneak out of the church, avoiding Alpha's watch. She made her way to the port where Gyogyo and the others were and they went to sea together. However, they saw themselves being pursued by Alpha, who found out about the plan and threatened to brutalize Bonney and have her crew killed. As Alpha used  to fly towards them, Bonney thought back to a conversation with Kuma, where she learned that Nika had a rubber-like body, thus she used a variant of her  technique to gain a physique like Nika and defeat Alpha in one punch, sending her into the ocean. Afterwards, the crew managed to set sail and it was reported that Bonney had escaped the government's custody.

The crew made it to an island where they knew Kuma would be and went to look for him while they were being chased by the Marines. However, Kuma noticed them and teleported away, as he knew he could not see her. As the crew was at sea, they suggested they could take their time searching for Kuma, with Bonney saying that they could also look for Nika. At this time, Luffy was given his first bounty, reaching those such as Jinbe and Kuma. This would also make Dragon plan on heading to Loguetown. As the Bonney Pirates adopted their own rules for piracy, Bonney made herself look grown up and wanted to make a name for herself as a pirate, hopeful it would get Kuma's attention.

At Egghead, with the Pacifista project ongoing, Vegapunk told Kuma the incident at  Enies Lobby about the boy who declared war on the government, and learned from him that the boy was Dragon's son, Luffy. Both of them found it odd that someone like him with the power of rubber were to challenge the government, much like Nika. Later, Kuma arrived at  Thriller Bark to capture Luffy after Moria's defeat, but decided to spare them after seeing how much his crew cared about him. Near the  Sabaody Archipelago, Kuma received a call from Marine Headquarters to report to  Marineford for Ace's execution and a war with the Whitebeard Pirates. He went to outside the restaurant where he saw Bonney and her crew inside, making it the last time he would see her before he lost his free will. On his way, he heard that a pirate attacked a  World Noble at the  Human Auctioning House. Kuma went to find out who it was as it is an act of treason that no one would dare to attempt, and was shocked to see that it was Luffy, who did it to protect  Hatchan. Right as the Straw Hat Pirates were being targeted by Kizaru, Kuma chose to separate them as he believed Luffy would one day save the world, and wanted him and his crew to get stronger in preparation for the New World.

At Egghead, Saturn asked for Vegapunk to install a self-destruct switch on Kuma, fearing the possibility of Kuma disobeying orders after his free will was lost. Vegapunk tried reasoning with Saturn to have Kuma switch between personalities to maintain his free will in some way, but Saturn did not give in to this idea as Kuma must not have any at all. Kuma had overheard this conversation with his supersonic hearing and was happy that Vegapunk thought of him. As it was time for Vegapunk to remove Kuma's free will, Kuma requested to be programmed so that after the Summit War, he would protect the Straw Hats' ship until a member of the crew returned, as after witnessing Luffy's actions, he believed the young pirate was capable of changing the world for the better. Kuma also created a copy of his memories for Vegapunk to study as part of the deal, as he remembered those he knew throughout his life and asked if he was a nuisance to them. Vegapunk sorrowfully replied that his death would be unfortunate for the people who cared about him and that he was a hero to Bonney and everyone. Kuma had one last request for Vegapunk to wish Bonney a happy tenth birthday if he saw her again. Afterwards, Vegapunk pulled the switch and Kuma's free will was removed, with Egghead's citizens and Sentomaru watching in grief.

Returning to the present, the bubble containing Kuma's memories had disappeared as Bonney found it. She learned about everything that happened and broke down crying.

#### From the Depths of Despair: Glimmers of Hope Arrive[]

Now knowing who her true enemy is, Bonney uses  on Saturn, but it doesn't work, and she feels weaker. Saturn deduces that Bonney is thinking of a different Nika from the real one, so Bonney can only copy the rubber ability part. Meanwhile, the others can't move because of Saturn's power, but Luffy starts eating food he found on the floor. After seeing this Saturn wondered where the food came from and commanded that Sea-Prism Stone be put on Luffy before he regains his strength. Saturn returns his focus on Bonney and revealed to her that she received the Toshi Toshi no Mi power because of him. Saturn conducted experiments on people to give them Devil Fruit powers without having to eat the actual fruit by using special drugs that he developed; Saturn gave both Ginny and Bonney this medicine but as a side effect, they contracted the Sapphire Scale disease. Upon hearing this Vegapunk became furious because this meant that Saturn was the one responsible for all of Kuma's suffering from start to finish. Furthermore, Saturn explained to Bonney that her Devil Fruit power lets her transform into any future she can think of, but as she learns more about the world, her future becomes more restricted. Thus, Bonney fell into despair as she began to doubt Nika's existence, so her Nika form became weaker. Bonney apologized to Kuma because she believed that was going to die even though Kuma sacrificed himself for her sake. As Saturn prepared to kill Bonney, Kuma appeared on Egghead and powered through the Marines, with the Authority Chip used to command the Pacifista unable to control Kuma.  Kuma protects Bonney by using himself as a shield, so Saturn can't kill her himself, before grabbing Saturn's leg from his back and preparing to punch a nervous and scared Saturn.
